I followed them down the hill. They both skillfully avoided the board in the road. I never saw it. He told me later that he saw me launch from my bike like a rocket. You must have gone 20 feet in the air before you landed. When Karen saw me lying motionless on the road, she said, Oh God, Dad, I think hes dead."

I followed them down the hill. They both skillfully avoided the board in the road. I never saw it. He told me later that he saw me launch from my bike like a rocket.

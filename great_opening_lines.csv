Bruce Barton,The Man Nobody Knows,1952,"It was very late in the afternoon. If you would like to learn the measure of a man that is the time of day to watch him. We are all half an inch taller in the morning than at night; it is fairly easy to take a large view of things when the mind is rested and the nerves are calm.

Rutger Bregman,Humankind,2019,"This is a book about a radical idea. An idea that’s long been known to make rulers nervous. An idea denied by religions and ideologies, ignored by the news media and erased from the annals of world history. At the same time, it’s an idea that’s legitimized by virtually every branch of science. One that’s corroborated by evolution and confirmed by everyday life. An ideal so intrinsic to human nature that it goes unnoticed and gets overlooked. If only we had the courage to take it more seriously, it’s an idea that might just start a revolution. Turn society on its head. Because once you grasp what it really means, it’s nothing less than a mind-bending drug that ensures you’ll never look at the world the same again. So what is this radical idea? That most people, deep down, are pretty decent."

Adam Gopnik,Angels and Ages,2009,"We are all pebbles dropped in the sea of history, where the splash strikes one way and the big tides run another, and though what we feel is the splash, the splash takes place only within those tides.

In her lonely bedroom, surrounded by the novels that had become her friends, she sometimes dared to dream of an adventure of her own, but not often. Her family repeatedly told her that it was the illness she’d survived in childhood that had transformed her life and left it fragile and solitary, and on good days, she believed it."

Ernest Hemingway,A Farewell to Arms,1929,"In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees. The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops marching along the road and the dust rising and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves."

Hermann Hesse,Steppenwolf,1927,"The day had gone by just as days go by. I had killed it in accordance with my primitive and retiring way of life. I had worked for an hour or two and perused the pages of old books. I had had pains for two hours, as elderly people do. I had taken a powder and been very glad when the pains consented to disappear. I had lain in a hot bath and absorbed its kindly warmth. Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour’s walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky. That was very delightful. So was the reading of old books. So was the lying in the warm bath."

Laura Hillenbrand,Seabiscuit,2001,"In 1938, near the end of a decade of monumental turmoil, the year’s number-one newsmaker was not Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Hitler, or Mussolini. It wasn’t Pope Pius XI, nor was it Lou Gehrig, Howard Hughes, or Clark Gable. The subject of the most newspaper column inches in 1938 wasn’t even a person. It was an undersized, crooked-legged racehorse named Seabiscuit."

David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers.
David Hume,An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Morals,1751,"Disputes with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are, of all others, the most irksome; except perhaps, those with persons, entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind."

John Irving,The World According to Garp,1978,"Garp’s mother, Jenny Fields, was arrested in Boston in 1942 for wounding a man in a movie theater.

John Irving,A Prayer for Owen Meany,1989,"I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice—not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother’s death, but because he is the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany."
John Irving,Last Night in Twisted River,2009,"The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long. For a frozen moment, his feet had stopped moving on the floating logs in the basin above the river bend; he’d slipped entirely underwater before anyone could grab his outstretched hand."
John Irving,In One Person,2012,"I’m going to begin by telling you about Miss Frost. While I say to everyone that I became a writer because I read a certain novel by Charles Dickens at the formative age of fifteen, the truth is I was younger than that when I first met Miss Frost and imagined having sex with her, and this moment of my sexual awakening also marked the fitful birth of my imagination."

Walter Isaacson,Benjamin Franklin,2003,"His arrival in Philadelphia is one of the most famous scenes in autobiographical literature: the bedraggled 17-year-old runaway, cheeky yet with a pretense of humility, straggling off the boat and buying three puffy rolls as he wanders up Market Street.

Kazuo Ishiguro,A Pale View of the Hills,1982,"Niki, the name we finally gave my younger daughter, is not an abbreviation; it was a compromise I reached with her father.

He finally agreed to Niki, thinking it had some vague echo of the East about it."

I know what comes next as surely as I know the Mississippi rolls down to the sea. The weeping passes, and rage takes hold. The rage burns out, and blame begins.

M. G. Lord,The Accidental Feminist,2012,"You could say it began in 1944 with National Velvet, when Elizabeth Taylor, age twelve, dressed as a boy and stole America’s collective heart. By “it,” I mean the subversive drumbeats of feminism, which swelled in the star’s important movies over decades from a delicate pitty-pat to a resounding roar."

Mary Roach,Stiff,2003,"The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you."
Mary Roach,Spook,2005,"I don’t recall my mood the morning I was born, but I imagine I felt a bit out of sorts. Nothing I looked at was familiar. People were staring at me and making odd sounds and wearing incomprehensible items. Everything seemed too loud, and nothing made the slightest amount of sense."
Mary Roach,Bonk,2008,"A man sits in a room, manipulating his kneecaps. It is 1983, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Philip Roth,American Pastoral,1997,"The Swede. During the war years, when I was still a grade school boy, this was a magical name in our Newark neighborhood, even to adults just a generation removed from the city’s old Prince Street ghetto and not yet so flawlessly Americanized as to be bowled over by the prowess of a high school athlete."
Salman Rushdie,The New Yorker,,"1989. Afterward, when the world was exploding around him, he felt annoyed with himself for having forgotten the name of the BBC reporter who told him that his old life was over and a new, darker existence was about to begin.

George Saunders,Lincoln in the Bardo,2017,"On our wedding day I was forty-six, she was eighteen.

That is exactly what I refused to do, you see."

Stacy Schiff,The Revolutionary,2022,Samuel Adams delivered what may count as the most remarkable second act in American life. It was all the more confounding after the first: he was a perfect failure until middle age.
Peter Schjeldahl,The Village Voice,,"At a dinner party recently, a nice young political consultant rhapsodized to me about the portent of the millennium, in which he saw the dawn of, yes, a New Age. I wasn’t having it. I remarked that scholars now date the birth of Jesus to about 6 B.C., so the millennium passed already."
Jennifer Senior,The Atlantic,,"When Bobby McIlvane died on September 11, 2001, his desk at home was a study in plate tectonics, coated in shifting piles of leather-bound diaries and yellow legal pads."
Rod Serling,Los Angeles Times,,"There is a bitter sadness and special irony that attends the passing of Martin Luther King. Quickly and with ease, we offer up a chorus of posthumous praise—the ritual dirge so time-honored and comfortable and undemanding of anything but rhetoric. In death, we offer the acknowledgement of the man and his dream that we denied him in life."
Robert Slater,Warrior Statesman,1991,"The black eyepatch dominated Moshe Dayan’s appearance, like some dark, spidery animal wrapped around his face."
Brendan Slocumb,The Violin Conspiracy,2022,"On the morning of the worst, most earth-shattering day of Ray McMillan’s life, he ordered room service: scrambled eggs for two, one side of regular bacon (for Nicole), one side of vegan sausage (for him), one coffee (for Nicole), one orange juice (for him)."

Francis Spufford,Cahokia Jazz,2024,"With the building dark beneath it, the skylight on the roof of the Land Trust was a pyramid of pure black. Down the smooth black of the glass, something sticky had run, black on black, all the way down into the crust of soft spring snow at Barrow’s feet, where it puddled in sunken loops and pools like molasses. On top, a contorted mass was somehow pinned or perched."
Richard Stengel,You’re Too Kind,2002,"Perfect, gentle reader: I will not begin this book with a tribute to your discernment, because a person of your obvious accomplishments would certainly be immune to such blandishments. You would surely see through such transparent puffery and reject it out of hand. Someone with as much self-assurance and insight as you would not want any soft soap and sycophancy, but rather candor and direct truth. Well, nothing personal, dear reader, but I doubt it."

William Styron,Sophie’s Choice,1979,"In those days cheap apartments were almost impossible to find in Manhattan, so I had to move to Brooklyn. This was in 1947, and one of the pleasant features of that summer which I so vividly remember was the weather, which was sunny and mild, flower-fragrant, almost as if the days had been arrested in a seemingly perpetual springtime. I was grateful for that if for nothing else, since my youth, I felt, was at its lowest ebb."
Patrick Süskind,Perfume,1985,In eighteenth-century France there lived a man who was one of the most gifted and abominable personages in an era that knew no lack of gifted and abominable personages. His story will be told here.
Earl Swift,The Big Roads,2011,"I was overdue for a road trip. It had been years since I’d last embraced that most cherished of American freedoms: to slide behind the wheel of a car equipped with a good stereo and comfortable seats, and head out into the country, beholden to no particular route, no timetable; to grow inured to the road, the thrum of the tires, the warbling silence and thuds of a big truck’s slipstream, the whistle of hot summer past the windows. To live off the contents of a cooler on the floorboards and whatever sustenance the road happened to offer."
Booth Tarkington,The Magnificent Ambersons,1918,"Major Amberson had “made a fortune” in 1873, when other people were losing fortunes, and the magnificence of the Ambersons began then."

Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,American Quarterly,2007,"Cotton Mather called them “The hidden ones.“ They never preached or sat in a deacon’s bench. Nor did they vote or attend Harvard. Neither, because they were virtuous women, did they question God or the magistrates. They prayed secretly, read the Bible through at least once a year, and went to hear the minister preach even when it snowed. Hoping for an eternal crown, they never asked to be remembered on earth. And they haven’t been. Well-behaved women seldom make history."

Robert Penn Warren,A Place to Come To,1977,"I was the only boy, or girl either, in the public school of Dugton, Claxford County, Alabama, whose father had ever got killed in the middle of the night standing up in the front of his wagon to piss on the hindquarters of one of a span of mules and, being drunk, pitching forward on his head, still hanging on to his dong, and hitting the pike in such a position and condition that both the left front and the left rear wheels of the wagon rolled, with perfect precision, over his unconscious neck, his having passed out being, no doubt, the reason he took the fatal plunge in the first place. Throughout, he was still holding on to his dong."

Bob Woodward,Rage,2020,"During the Top Secret President’s Daily Brief the afternoon of Tuesday, January 28, 2020, discussion in the Oval Office turned to a mysterious pneumonia-like virus outbreak in China. Public health officials and President Trump himself were telling the public the virus was low-risk for the United States. “This will be the biggest national security threat you face in your presidency,” Robert O’Brien, the national security adviser, told Trump, expressing a jarring, contrarian view as deliberately and as strongly as possible.

Herman Wouk,The Caine Mutiny,1951,"It was not a mutiny in the old-time sense, of course, with flashing of cutlasses, a captain in chains, and desperate sailors turning outlaws. After all, it happened in 1944 in the United States Navy. But the court of inquiry recommended trial for mutiny, and the episode became known as “the Caine mutiny” throughout the service. The story begins with Willie Keith because the event turned on his personality as the massive door of a vault turns on a small jewel bearing."
Herman Wouk,The Winds of War,1971,"Commander Victor Henry rode a taxicab home from the Navy Building on Constitution Avenue, in a gusty gray March rainstorm that matched his mood.

Chinua Achebe,A Man of the People,1966,"No one can deny that Chief the Honorable M. A. Nanga, M.P. was the most approachable politician in the country.

Madeleine Albright,Prague Winter,,"I was fifty-nine when I began serving as U.S. secretary of state. I thought by then that I knew all there was to know about my past, who “my people” were, and the history of my native land. I was sure enough that I did not feel a need to ask questions.

W. Kamau Bell,Vanity Fair,,"I am afraid of the cops. Absolutely petrified of the cops. Now understand, I’ve never been arrested or held for questioning.

Joe Biden,Promises to Keep,2007,"Joe Impedimenta, my classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day. It was one of the first big words we learned. Impedimenta—the baggage that impedes one’s progress."

Christopher Buckley,Make Russia Great Again,2020,"“How could you work for a man like that?” “What were you thinking?” “What possessed you?” All the time I get this, even in here, which frankly strikes me as a bit rich.

Louis de Bernières,The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman,1992,"Once again, Cardinal Dominic Trujillo Guzman felt a pang like that of childbirth spear him in the belly, and he doubled over, clutching himself and moaning.

Al Franken,Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,1996,"After Delacorte asked me to write a book on politics, my very first creative act was coming up with the title Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations.

Betty Friedan,The Feminine Mystique,1963,"The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night—she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question—“Is this all?“"

Hermann Hesse,Steppenwolf,1927,"The day had gone by just as days go by. I had killed it in accordance with my primitive and retiring way of life. I had worked for an hour or two and perused the pages of old books. I had had pains for two hours, as elderly people do. I had taken a powder and been very glad when the pains consented to disappear. I had lain in a hot bath and absorbed its kindly warmth. Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour’s walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky. That was very delightful. So was the reading of old books. So was the lying in the warm bath."
Anita Hill,"Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home",2011,"In August 1973, three weeks past my seventeenth birthday, I packed my clothes in three hand-me-down Samsonite suitcases and left the only place I had ever called home.

David Hume,An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Morals,1751,"Disputes with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are, of all others, the most irksome; except perhaps, those with persons, entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind."

I know what comes next as surely as I know the Mississippi rolls down to the sea. The weeping passes, and rage takes hold. The rage burns out, and blame begins.

The Halls were noted for their beauty and charm in the days when New York City was small enough to have a society spelled with a capital S!

Earl Swift,The Big Roads,2011,"I was overdue for a road trip. It had been years since I’d last embraced that most cherished of American freedoms: to slide behind the wheel of a car equipped with a good stereo and comfortable seats, and head out into the country, beholden to no particular route, no timetable; to grow inured to the road, the thrum of the tires, the warbling silence and thuds of a big truck’s slipstream, the whistle of hot summer past the windows.

We are all half an inch taller in the morning than at night; it is fairly easy to take a large view of things when the mind is rested and the nerves are calm.

Blayney Colmore,I Reserve the Right to be Terrified,2022,"The road was steep. But it leveled off at the bottom, so you got a nice glide before the next hill. We’d ridden that road a lot, so we let the bikes run. Last I looked at the speedometer it read between 30 and 35 miles per hour. Exhilarating. Conrad and his daughter Karen were much more experienced and stronger bikers than I was. I followed them down the hill. They both skillfully avoided the board in the road. I never saw it. He told me later that he saw me launch from my bike like a rocket. “You must have gone 20 feet in the air before you landed.” When Karen saw me lying motionless on the road, she said, “Oh God, Dad, I think he’s dead.”"

Adam Gopnik,Angels and Ages,2009,"We are all pebbles dropped in the sea of history, where the splash strikes one way and the big tides run another, and though what we feel is the splash, the splash takes place only within those tides. In almost every case, the incoming current drowns the splash; once in a while the drop of the pebble changes the way the ocean runs."
Stephen Jay Gould,The Flamingo’s Smile: Reflections in Natural History,1985,The human mind delights in finding pattern—so much so that we often mistake coincidence or forced analogy for profound meaning.
Graham Greene,The Power and the Glory,1940,Mr. Tench went out to look for his ether cylinder: out into the blazing Mexican sun and the bleaching dust. A few buzzards looked down from the roof with shabby indifference: he wasn’t carrion yet.

Sam Harris,Lying,2013,"Among the many paradoxes of human life, this is perhaps the most peculiar and consequential: We often behave in ways that are guaranteed to make us unhappy."
Kirk Hazen,TheConversation.com,,What in tarnation is “tarnation?” Why do people in old books exclaim “zounds!” in moments of surprise? And what could a professor of linguistics possibly have against “duck-loving crickets?”
James Hilton,Lost Horizon,1933,"Cigars had burned low, and we were beginning to sample the disillusionment that usually afflicts old school friends who meet again as men and find themselves with less in common than they used to think."
Victor Hugo,Les Misérables,,"In the year 1815 Monseigneur Charles-François-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of Digne. He was then about seventy-five, having held the bishopric since 1806."
David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"To some philosophers it appears [a] matter of surprise that all mankind, possessing the same nature and being endowed with the same faculties, should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations, and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by the other."
David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"Political writers have established it as a maxim that, in contriving any system of government…every man ought to be supposed a knave, and to have no other end in all his actions than private interest."
David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers.
David Hume,An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Morals,1751,"Disputes with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are, of all others, the most irksome; except perhaps, those with persons, entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind."
Molly Ivins,The Progressive,,"You could probably prove, by judicious use of logarithms and congruent triangles, that real life is a lot more like soap opera than most people will admit."
Immanuel Kant,Berlin Monthly,,Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-incurred immaturity.

Walter Lippmann,A Preface to Morals,1929,"Among those who no longer believe in the religion of their fathers, some are proudly defiant, and many are indifferent.

Alexander McCall Smith,The Sunday Philosophy Club,2004,"Isabel Dalhousie saw the young man fall from the upper circle, from the gods."
Mary McCarthy,The New Yorker,,"Teaching for the wisest of the ancients, was only a form of prompting. Socrates’ pupils, who sought to know what was love, what was justice, what was beauty, and so on, were shown by the philosopher that they already knew the answers to these questions, though they did not know they knew them…."
Thomas Merton,No Man is an Island,1955,A happiness that is sought for ourselves alone can never be found; for a happiness that is diminished by being shared is not big enough to make us happy.

J. Leslie Mitchell,Spartacus,1933,"When Kleon heard the news from Capua he rose early one morning, being a literatus and unchained, crept to the room of his Master, stabbed him in the throat, mutilated that Master’s body even as his own had been mutilated: and so fled from Rome with a stained dagger in his sleeve and a copy of The Republic of Plato hidden in his breast."

Walker Percy,The Moviegoer,1961,"This morning I got a note from my aunt asking me to come for lunch. I know what this means. Since I go there every Sunday for dinner and today is Wednesday, it can mean only one thing: she wants to have one of her serious talks."
Wintley Phipps,Your Best Destiny,,It is no accident that you picked up this book. You’re searching for something.
Sidney Poitier,The Measure of a Man,2000,"Many years ago I wrote a book about my life, which was, necessarily, in large part a book about my life in Hollywood.

Ayn Rand,Atlas Shrugged,1957,Who is John Galt?
Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"If you want me to name in one sentence what is wrong with the modern world, I will say that never before has the world been clamoring so desperately for answers to crucial problems—and never before has the world been so frantically committed to the belief that no answers are possible."
Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"“God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to change things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” This remarkable statement is attributed to a theologian with whose ideas I disagree in every fundamental respect: Reinhold Niebuhr. But—omitting the form of a prayer, i.e., the implication that one’s mental-emotional states are a gift from God—that statement is profoundly true, as a summary and a guideline: It names the mental attitude which a rational man must seek to achieve.”"
Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"The most appropriate title for this discussion would be “I told you so.” But since that would be in somewhat dubious taste, I shall leave this untitled."

Bertrand Russell,Our Knowledge of the External World,1914,"Philosophy, from the earliest times, has made greater claims, and achieved fewer results, than any other branch of learning."
Bertrand Russell,The Dial,,"Moralists, in the main, have been a somewhat forbidding race. Their main preoccupation has usually been to try to prevent people from doing that they wanted to do, on the ground—formerly explicit, but now seldom avowed—that the natural man is wicked."
Bertrand Russell,The Conquest of Happiness,1930,"Animals are happy so long as they have health and enough to eat. Human beings, one feels, ought to be, but in the modern world they are not, at least in a great majority of cases."
Bertrand Russell,Why I Am Not a Christian,1952,Many people tell us that without a belief in God a man can be neither happy nor virtuous.
Bertrand Russell,My Philosophical Development,1959,My philosophical development may be divided into various stages according to the problems with which I have been concerned and the men whose work has influenced me.

Carl Safina,Becoming Wild,2020,"A flock of scarlet macaws bursts from the deep rainforest like flaming comets, several dozen big, bright birds with streaming tails and hot colors. With much self-generated fanfare, they settle into high trees above a steep riverbank. They’re noisy and playful. If this is the serious business of their lives, they seem to be enjoying themselves and each other."
José Saramago,Cain,2009,"When the lord, also known as god, realized that adam and eve, although perfect in every outward aspect, could not utter a word or make even the most primitive of sounds, he must have felt annoyed with himself, for there was no one else in the garden of eden whom he could blame for this grave oversight, after all, the other animals, who were, like the two humans, the product of his divine command, already had a voice of their own, be it a bellow, a roar, a croak, a chirp, a whistle or a cackle."

Emily Shugerman,The Daily Beast,,"When volunteers at Venue Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, arrived at their pastor’s house last November, they were hoping to raise his spirits with a surprise visit.

Jonathan Swift,Miscellanies,1711,"We have just religion enough to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another."
Barbara Brown Taylor,An Altar in the World,2009,"If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say, “I am spiritual but not religious,” then I might not be any wiser about what that means—but I would be richer. I hear the phrase on the radio. I read it in interviews. People often say it to my face when they learn that I am a religion professor who spent years as a parish priest."
Barbara Brown Taylor,Holy Envy,2019,"The book in your hands is a small window on a large subject. Set at a private liberal arts college in the foothills of the Appalachians, it is the story of a Christian minister who lost her way in the church and found a new home in the classroom."
Henry David Thoreau,Walden,1854,"When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again."
Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,American Quarterly,2007,"Cotton Mather called them “The hidden ones.“ They never preached or sat in a deacon’s bench. Nor did they vote or attend Harvard. Neither, because they were virtuous women, did they question God or the magistrates. They prayed secretly, read the Bible through at least once a year, and went to hear the minister preach even when it snowed. Hoping for an eternal crown, they never asked to be remembered on earth. And they haven’t been. Well-behaved women seldom make history."
Erich von Däniken,Chariots of the Gods?,1968,"It took courage to write this book, and it will take courage to read it."
Dan Wakefield,The New York Times Magazine,,"Just before Christmas of 1980, I was sitting in the Sevens, a neighborhood bar on Beacon Hill (don’t all these stories of revelation begin in bars?), when a housepainter named Tony remarked out of the blue that he wanted to find a place to go to mass on Christmas Eve. I didn’t say anything, but a thought came into my mind, as swift and unexpected as it was unfamiliar: I’d like to do that, too."

David Waltner-Toews,One Animal Among Many,1991,"According to some commentators on the Jewish Talmud, God tried creation twenty-six times before this one.

Alan Watts,The Wisdom of Insecurity,1951,By all outward appearances our life is a spark of light between one eternal darkness and another.
Alan Watts,The Way of Zen,1957,Zen Buddhism is a way and a view of life which does not belong to any of the formal categories of modern Western thought. It is not religion or philosophy; it is not a psychology or a type of science. It is an example of what is known in India and China as a “way of liberation.”
Edith Wharton,Hudson River Bracketed,1929,"By the time he was nineteen Vance Weston had graduated from the College of Euphoria, Illinois, where his parents then lived, had spent a week in Chicago, invented a new religion, and edited for a few months a college magazine called “Getting There,” to which he had contributed several love poems and a series of iconoclastic essays."
Ken Wilber,No Boundary,1979,"Suddenly, without any warning, at any place or time, with no apparent cause, it can happen."
Ken Wilber,"Sex, Ecology, Spirituality",1995,"It is flat-out strange that something—that anything—is happening. There was nothing, then a Big Bang, then here we all are. This is extremely weird."
Ken Wilber,A Theory of Everything,2000,"We live in an extraordinary time: all of the world’s cultures, past and present, are to some degree available to us, either in historical records or as living entities. In the history of the planet Earth, this has never happened before."
Robert S. Wistrich,A Lethal Obsession,2009,Future historians may well regard the past seven decades as a golden age of ideological politics.
Eric Zorn,The Chicago Tribune,,"Straight from the mouth of Jesus come words that ought to appear, at least paraphrased, in 10-inch-high letters at the front of every public and private school classroom in America: “As you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.“"
Mortimer J. Adler,The Saturday Review of Literature,,"You know you have to read “between the lines” to get the most out of anything. I want to persuade you to do something equally important in the course of your reading. I want to persuade you to “write between the lines.” Unless you do, you are not likely to do the most efficient kind of reading."
Felipe Alfau,Chromos,1990,"The moment one learns English, complications set in."
Isabel Allende,The Sum of Our Days,2008,"There is no lack of drama in my life. I have more than enough three-ring-circus material for writing, but even so, I always approach the seventh of January with trembling. Last night I couldn’t sleep."
Isaac Asimov,Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction,,"I have written three hundred ninety-nine essays for Fantasy & Science Fiction. The essays were written with enormous pleasure, for I have always been allowed to say what I wanted to say. It was with horror that I discovered I could not manage a four hundredth essay."
Isaac Asimov,"I, Asimov",1994,"In 1977, I wrote my autobiography. Since I was dealing with my favorite subject, I wrote at length and I ended with 640,000 words."
W. H. Auden,Introduction,1950,What every author hopes to receive from posterity—a hope usually disappointed—is justice.
W. H. Auden,The New Yorker,,"I never enjoy having to find fault with a book, and when the author is someone I have met and like, I hate it."
W. H. Auden,Forewords and Afterwards,1971,"So far as I know, Goethe was the first writer or artist to become a Public Celebrity."
W. H. Auden,Forewords and Afterwards,1964,"Probably, more nonsense has been talked and written, more intellectual and emotional energy expended in vain, on the sonnets of Shakespeare than on any other literary work in the world."
W. H. Auden,Forewords and Afterwards,1961,"The mating of minds is, surely, quite as fascinating a relationship as the mating of the sexes, yet how little attention novelists have paid to it."
Paul Auster,Burning Boy,2021,"Born on the Day of the Dead and dead five months before his twenty-ninth birthday, Stephen Crane lived five months and five days into the twentieth century, undone by tuberculosis before he had a chance to drive an automobile or see an airplane, to watch a film projected on a large screen or listen to a radio, a figure from the horse-and-buggy world who missed out on the future that was awaiting his peers, not just the construction of those miraculous machines and inventions but the horrors of the age as well, including the destruction of tens of millions of lives in two wars."
James Baldwin,Notes of a Native Son,1955,I was born in Harlem thirty-one years ago. I began plotting novels at about the time I learned to read.
Dave Barry,Dave Barry Talks Back,1991,"I am always getting letters from people who want my job. “Dave,” they start out. They always call me Dave. “Dave,” they say, “I want your job, because my current job requires me to be a responsible person doing productive work, whereas your job requires you mainly to think up booger jokes."
Greg Bellow,Saul Bellow’s Heart,2013,"On a visit to Chicago when I was eight, I witnessed a terrible argument, in Yiddish, between my father and grandfather. Driving away from his father’s house, Saul started to cry so bitterly he had to pull off the road. After a few minutes, he excused his lapse of self-control by saying, “It’s okay for grown-ups to cry.“ I knew his heart was breaking. I knew because of the bond between my father’s tender heart and mine."
Ambrose Bierce,Write It Right,1909,"The author’s main purpose in this book is to teach precision in writing; and of good writing (which, essentially, is clear thinking made visible) precision is the point of capital concern."
Sven Birkets,Los Angeles Review of Books,,"Teaching writing, unlike most other kinds of teaching, is an intervention, closer to therapy than to any transmissible instruction."
Erin Blakemore,The Heroine’s Bookshelf,2010,"In times of struggle, there are as many reasons not to read as there are to breathe. Don’t you have better things to do? Reading, let alone rereading, is the terrain of milquetoasts and mopey spinsters. At life’s ugliest junctures, the very act of opening a book can smack of cowardly escapism. Who chooses to read when there’s work to be done?"
Lawrence Block,The Crime of Our Lives,2015,It was in the eleventh grade that I knew I would be a writer. The conviction grew out of two awarenesses that dawned at about the same time.
"Roy Blount, Jr.",The New York Times,,A feeling seems to have arisen that summer is the time for light reading. I don’t know where anyone got that idea.
Camille Bordas,The Material,2024,"On Wednesdays, three of them had to perform, in turn, a four-to-six-minute routine that the whole class then proceeded to rip apart, joke by joke, beat by beat, until there wasn’t anything left and the budding comedians went home to consider other possible career paths."
Anita Brookner,The Debut,1981,"Dr. Weiss, at forty, knew that her life had been ruined by literature."
Geraldine Brooks,March,2005,"This is what I write to her: The clouds tonight embossed the sky. A dipping sun gilded and brazed each raveling edge as if the firmament were threaded through with precious filaments. I pause there to mop my aching eye, which will not stop tearing. The line I have set down is, perhaps, on the florid side of fine, but no matter: she is a gentle critic."

Frank Bruni,The Beauty of Dusk,2022,"They say that death comes like a thief in the night. Lesser vandals have the same MO. The affliction that stole my vision, or at least a big chuck of it, did so as I slept. I went to bed seeing the world one way. I woke up seeing it another."
Bill Bryson,The Mother Tongue,1990,"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say the results are sometimes mixed."
Christopher Buckley,Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir,2009,"I’m not sure how this book will turn out. I mostly write novels, and I’ve found, having written half a dozen, that if you’re lucky, the ending turns out a surprise and you wind up with something you hadn’t anticipated in the outline. I suppose it’s a process of outsmarting yourself (not especially hard in my case)."
Christopher Buckley,Has Anyone Seen My Toes?,2022,He shuffles to the bathroom scale and steps onto it with the enthusiasm of a man mounting the gallows.
Anthony Burgess,Earthly Powers,1980,"It was the afternoon of my eighty-first birthday, and I was in bed with my catamite when Ali announced that the archbishop had come to see me."

Casey Cep,The New Yorker,,"Killing children is generally frowned upon, but Edward Gorey did it all the time."
Michael Chabon,Wonder Boys,1995,The first real writer I ever knew was a man who did all of his work under the name of August Van Zorn.

Maureen Corrigan,"Leave Me Alone, I’m Reading",2005,It’s not that I don’t like people. It’s just that when I’m in the company of others—even my nearest and dearest—there always comes a moment when I’d rather be reading a book.

William Deresiewicz,A Jane Austen Education,2011,"I was twenty-six, and about as dumb, in all human things, as any twenty-six-year-old has a right to be, when I met the woman who would change my life. That she’d been dead for a couple of hundred years made not the slightest difference whatsoever."
Denis Diderot,Rameau’s Nephew,1762,"Come rain or shine, my custom is to go for a stroll in the Palais-Royal every afternoon about five. I am always to be seen there alone, sitting on a seat in the Allée d’Argenson, meditating."
Joan Didion,The White Album,1979,We tell ourselves stories in order to live.
Annie Dillard,The Writing Life,1989,"When you write, you lay out a line of words. The line of words is a miner’s pick, a woodcarver’s gouge, a surgeon’s probe. You wield it, and it digs a path you follow."
Michael Dirda,An Open Book,2003,Daydreaming is my only hobby.
Michael Dirda,Classics for Pleasure,2007,"Classics for pleasure? To some readers this may seem an oxymoron. Aren’t classics supposed to be difficult, esoteric, and a little boring? Yes, teachers and critics claim they’re good for you, but so are milk of magnesia and cod-liver oil. Really, after a hard day’s work, who wants to settle down for more…work? A fast-moving thriller or a steamy romance—those sound more like it."
Maggie Doherty,The New Yorker,,Elizabeth Hardwick was a master of the opening sentence. Few writers have the guts to begin so boldly—or with so many adjectives.
Mark Doty,Granta,,"Only a sentence, casually placed as a footnote in the back of Justin Kaplan’s thick 2003 biography of Walt Whitman, but it goes off like a little explosion: “Bram Stoker based the character of Dracula on Walt Whitman….”"
Daphne du Maurier,Myself When Young,1977,All autobiography is self-indulgent.
Dominick Dunne,Justice,2001,"I didn’t start writing until I was fifty years old although an observer’s eye had been observing for forty of those fifty years, while trying out different areas of occupation."
Jacqueline Faber,Writer’s Digest,,"If the salesperson’s edict is to “always be closing,” the writer’s first mandate is to nail the opening. When it works, it feels like alchemy. Inevitable, a product that is more than the sum of its parts. When it doesn’t, we feel it as a creeping sense of distrust in the authorial prime mover who ushers us along."
Anne Fadiman,The Wine Lover’s Daughter,2017,"My father was a lousy driver and a two-finger typist, but he could open a wine bottle as deftly as any swain ever undressed his lover."
Lucien Febvre,A New Kind of History,1930,"It is never a waste of time to study the history of a word. Such journeys, whether short or long, monotonous or varied, are always instructive."
Jules Feiffer,The Great Comic Book Heroes,,"Comic books, World War II, the Depression, and I all got going at roughly the same time. I was eight."
Edna Ferber,A Peculiar Treasure,1938,"When I was a small girl living in Appleton, Wisconsin, I often was sent with a quart tin pail to the creamery which was three blocks away on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. The Ferber family, I hastily and grandly add, lived on the right side of the tracks. Any native Middle West American will get the social significance (and the revolting snobbery) of that statement."

Jasper Fforde,The Eyre Affair,2001,My father had a face that could stop a clock.
John Ficara,The Washington Post,,"The English language has something to confuse or annoy just about anyone—the mysteries of who and whom usage, the e.g. vs. i.e. standoff, the polarizing Oxford comma. I have a long-standing, personal problem with heteronyms—words that are spelled the same but don’t sound alike. Allow me to explain with a little story."
Judith Flanders,The Invention of Murder,2011,"“Pleasant it is, no doubt, to drink tea with your sweetheart, but most disagreeable to find her bubbling in the tea-urn.“ So wrote Thomas de Quincy in 1826, and indeed, it is hard to argue with him."
Mark Forsyth,The Elements of Eloquence,2013,"Shakespeare was not a genius. He was, without the distant shadow of a doubt, the most wonderful writer who ever breathed. But not a genius.

Paul Gallico,The Silent Miaow,1957,"When I was a very young kitten, I had the misfortune to lose my mother and find myself alone in the world at age six weeks. However, I was not unduly disturbed by this since I was intelligent, not ill favored, resourceful and full of confidence in myself. Also I had had the advantage of several weeks of instruction from my mother before her unfortunate encounter with a motorcar at night."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"It must have been a gas, to borrow one of his favorite terms, to get a letter from Terry Southern. Each was its own little acid trip, streaked with innuendo and poached in a satirical kind of intellectual flop sweat. He used thin, expensive paper and sealed some of his letters with wax. People were said to read them aloud to whoever was in the room."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour, is about a young woman who turns into a leaf. “Unrequited love’s a bore,” Billie Holiday sang. So, it turns out, is photosynthesis."

David Gerrold,Worlds of Wonder,2018,"The very best writing instructor I ever had was an incompetent. A terminal alcoholic who could barely find the classroom each day, he was a bleary-eyed, red-nosed, overstuffed, walking elbow-wrinkle of a human being. Whatever writing ability he’d ever had, he’d long since drowned it, and the corpse was a layer of dried sediment at the bottom of a bottle. He didn’t like me either."
Richard Goodman,The Writer’s Chronicle,,"The beginning of your story, essay, or novel carries more weight than any other part of your work. This is simply because it is the beginning."
Richard Goodman,The Writer’s Chronicle,,"Henry James the novelist largely overshadows Henry James the literary critic. In many ways, though, the critic is more appealing, and certainly more accessible, than the novelist."
Doris Kearns Goodwin,Leadership in Turbulent Times,2018,"Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson—the lives and times of these four men have occupied me for half a century.

John Green,Looking for Alaska,2005,"The week before I left my family and Florida and the rest of my minor life to go to boarding school in Alabama, my mother insisted on throwing me a going-away party. To say that I had low expectations would be to underestimate the matter dramatically."
Graham Greene,The End of the Affair,1951,"A story has no beginning or end: arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which, to look ahead."
Kristin Hannah,The Four Winds,2021,"Elsa Wolcott had spent years in enforced solitude, reading fictional adventures and imagining other lives. In her lonely bedroom, surrounded by the novels that had become her friends, she sometimes dared to dream of an adventure of her own, but not often. Her family repeatedly told her that it was the illness she’d survived in childhood that had transformed her life and left it fragile and solitary, and on good days, she believed it."

O. Henry,The Four Million,1906,"It was a day in March. Never, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could possibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere wind. But in this instance it is allowable."
O. Henry,The Voice of the City,1908,There are a few editor men with whom I am privileged to come in contact. It has not been long since it was their habit to come in contact with me. There is a difference.

John Irving,In One Person,2012,"I’m going to begin by telling you about Miss Frost. While I say to everyone that I became a writer because I read a certain novel by Charles Dickens at the formative age of fifteen, the truth is I was younger than that when I first met Miss Frost and imagined having sex with her, and this moment of my sexual awakening also marked the fitful birth of my imagination."
Walter Isaacson,American Sketches,2009,I was once asked to contribute an essay to the Washington Post for a page called “The Writing Life”. This caused me some consternation.
Lily King,Writers and Lovers,2020,"I have a pact with myself not to think about money in the morning. I’m like a teenager trying not to think about sex. Or Luke. Or death.

Katia Lief,Invisible Woman,2024,"The first time the thought came to her, with clarity instead of anger, it was a warm evening in June not long before the party that was supposed to launch a new phase of her husband’s brilliant career. She was standing at the kitchen sink sponging tomato sauce off a white plate. She rinsed it and set it dripping in the dish drainer, then picked up a wineglass and scrubbed at a haze of lip gloss biting the rim. She put the glass down but left the water running, as if the sound could blot out her thoughts, as if he could hear them through the linkage of empty rooms. What if I killed him?"

W. Somerset Maugham,Strictly Personal,1941,"I have a notion that it is well to tell the reader at the beginning of a narrative what he is in for, and so I shall start by telling you that this is not an account of great events, but of the small things that happened to me during the first fifteen months of the war."
W. Somerset Maugham,The Razor’s Edge,1944,I have never begun a novel with more misgiving. If I call it a novel it is only because I don’t know what else to call it.

Lance Morrow,The Wall Street Journal,,"I once knew a magazine journalist who was addicted to metaphors. He was, so to speak, an alcoholic of metaphors.

Anna Quindlen,"Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake",2012,"It’s odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn’t know who I was.

Salman Rushdie,The New Yorker,,"1989. Afterward, when the world was exploding around him, he felt annoyed with himself for having forgotten the name of the BBC reporter who told him that his old life was over and a new, darker existence was about to begin.

Vita Sackville-West,The Edwardians,1930,"Among the many problems which beset the novelist, not the least weighty is the choice of the moment at which to begin his novel."
Sam Savage,Firmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife,2006,"I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov’s “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins”; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy’s “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier: “This is the saddest story I have ever heard.” I’ve read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off. Ford Madox Ford was a Big One."

Charles M. Schulz,My Life with Charlie Brown,,"And so, 25 years have gone by. At one strip per day, that comes to almost 10,000 comic strips. Actually, this is not so much when you consider the longevity of many other comic features. Employees receive wristwatches if they have put in this much time with a company, but a comic-strip artist just keeps on drawing. (Somehow a comic-strip artist is never regarded as an employee.)"
Murray Schumach,The New York Times,,It was not quite proper to have printed The Carpetbaggers between covers of a book. It should have been inscribed on the walls of a public lavatory.
Parul Sehgal,The New Yorker,,"It is a truth only fitfully acknowledged that whom the gods wish to destroy, they first give an opinion column."
Peter Selgin,Your First Page,,"I once spoke with a New York City fireman whose job included talking suicidal “jumpers” down from building edges and bridges. He told me something that has stayed with me ever since. He said that in every case, without exception, when the person jumped, the look on his or her face was always the same. It said, in essence, “Wrong decision.”"
Josh Shaffer,News &amp; Observer,,"To the ears of a musical novice, the tuba ranks lowest in the family of instruments—an oafish cousin with a voice like a bullfrog. It lacks the flash of a saxophone, the brashness of a trumpet or the showiness of a piccolo—the melodic equivalent of a St. Bernard, warbling from the orchestra’s back row."

Lemony Snicket (pen name of Daniel Handler),"The Bad Beginning, or, Orphans",1999,"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.

Lemony Snicket (pen name of Daniel Handler),The Austere Academy,2000,"If you were going to give a gold medal to the least delightful person on Earth, you would have to give that medal to a person named Carmelita Spats, and if you didn’t give it to her, Carmelita Spats was the sort of person who would snatch it from your hands anyway."
Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"One evening over dinner in March 2008, I began to joke, as I often had before, about writing an essay called “Men Explain Things to Me.” Every writer has a stable of ideas that never make it to the racetrack, and I’d been trotting this pony out recreationally once in a while."

Howard Sounes,Charles Bukowski,1998,"Charles Bukowski raised himself up from his chair and got a beer from the refrigerator behind him on stage.

C. Fields. “It’s a necesssssity.”"

William Styron,Sophie’s Choice,1979,"In those days cheap apartments were almost impossible to find in Manhattan, so I had to move to Brooklyn. This was in 1947, and one of the pleasant features of that summer which I so vividly remember was the weather, which was sunny and mild, flower-fragrant, almost as if the days had been arrested in a seemingly perpetual springtime. I was grateful for that if for nothing else, since my youth, I felt, was at its lowest ebb."
Gay Talese,The Kingdom and the Power,1969,"Most journalists are restless voyeurs who see the warts on the world, the imperfections in people and places."
Greg Tamblyn,Atilla the Gate Agent,2007,"I once had an engagement in the town of Normal, Illinois.

I don’t think it’s any accident of the universe that I live a lot closer to Peculiar than Normal."
Rufi Thorpe,Margo’s Got Money Troubles,2024,"You are about to begin reading a new book, and to be honest, you are a little tense. The beginning of a novel is like a first date.

Kenneth Tynan,The Observer,1964,"Nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth, and the reason is not far to seek. Instead of growing as the play proceeds, the hero shrinks; complex and many-levelled to begin with, he ends up a cornered thug, lacking even a death scene with which to regain lost stature."
Kenneth Tynan,The Observer,1964,"Night- nurses at the bedside of good drama, we critics keep a holy vigil. Black circles rim our eyes as we pray for the survival of our pet patient…."

John Updike,Assorted Prose,1965,Pity the poor bore. He stands among us as a creature formidable and familiar yet in essence unknowable. We can read of the ten infallible signs whereby he may be recognized and of the seven tested methods whereby he may be rebuffed.
John Updike,Self-Consciousness,1989,"Had not my twenty-five-year-old daughter undertipped the airline porter in Boston, our luggage might have shown upon the carrousel [sic] in Allentown that April afternoon in 1980, and I would not have spent an evening walking the sidewalks of Shillington, Pennsylvania, searching for the meaning for my existence, as once I had scanned those same sidewalks for lost pennies."

Hugh Walpole,The Silver Thorn: A Book of Stories,1928,"As Foster moved unconsciously across the room, bent towards the bookcase, and stood leaning forward a little, choosing now one book, now another with his eye, his host, seeing the muscles of the back of his thin, scraggy neck stand out above his low flannel collar, thought of the ease with which he could squeeze that throat and the pleasure, the triumphant, lustful pleasure, that such an action would give him."

H. G. Wells,Certain Personal Matters,1898,"The art of the essayist is so simple, so entirely free from canons of criticism, and withal so delightful, that one must needs wonder why all men are not essayists. Perhaps people do not know how easy it is. Or perhaps beginners are misled. Rightly taught it may be learnt in a brief ten minutes or so, what art there is in it. And all the rest is as easy as wandering among woodlands on a bright morning in the spring."
Colson Whitehead,Apex Hides the Hurt,2006,He came up with the names.

William Zinsser,Spring Training,1989,"This book was born, though I didn’t know it at the time, seven years ago in Winter Haven, Florida, at the spring training camp of the Boston Red Sox. I was sitting in the grandstand in a sea of codgers, codging the time away."
William Zinsser,Inventing the Truth,,"This is the age of the memoir. Never have personal narratives gushed so profusely from the American soil as in the closing decade of the twentieth century. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone is telling it."

Dave Barry,The Miami Herald,,"OK. You turned 50. You know you’re supposed to get a colonoscopy. But you haven’t. Here are your reasons: 1. You’ve been busy. 2. You don’t have a history of cancer in your family. 3. You haven’t noticed any problems. 4. You don’t want a doctor to stick a tube 17,000 feet up your butt."
Catherine Belling,A Condition of Doubt,2012,"Hypochondriacs have two significant beliefs; that their bodies contain something that will kill them, and that, if they could only read their bodies closely enough, they should be able to find that lurking threat before it is too late."
Elizabeth Berg,Talk Before Sleep,1994,"This morning, before I came to Ruth’s house, I made yet another casserole for my husband and daughter. Meggie likes casseroles while Joe only endures them, but they are all I can manage right now. I put the dish in the refrigerator, with a note taped on it telling how long to cook it, and at what temperature, and that they should have a salad, too."
Cat Bohannon,Eve,2023,"Elizabeth Shaw has a problem. The director Ridley Scott has impregnated her with a large, vicious alien squid. Aboard the spaceship Prometheus, she has to find a way to abort her uninvited guest without bleeding to death. Shambling to a futuristic surgery pod, she asks the computer for a C-section. “Error,” it says, “this medpod is calibrated for male patients only.” “Shit,” said a woman behind me, “who does that?”"
Rutger Bregman,Humankind,2019,"This is a book about a radical idea. An idea that’s long been known to make rulers nervous. An idea denied by religions and ideologies, ignored by the news media and erased from the annals of world history. At the same time, it’s an idea that’s legitimized by virtually every branch of science. One that’s corroborated by evolution and confirmed by everyday life. An ideal so intrinsic to human nature that it goes unnoticed and gets overlooked. If only we had the courage to take it more seriously, it’s an idea that might just start a revolution. Turn society on its head. Because once you grasp what it really means, it’s nothing less than a mind-bending drug that ensures you’ll never look at the world the same again. So what is this radical idea? That most people, deep down, are pretty decent."
Frank Bruni,The Beauty of Dusk,2022,"They say that death comes like a thief in the night. Lesser vandals have the same MO. The affliction that stole my vision, or at least a big chuck of it, did so as I slept. I went to bed seeing the world one way. I woke up seeing it another."

Kelly Corrigan,The Middle Place,2008,"The thing you need to know about me is that I am George Corrigan’s daughter, his only daughter. You may have met him, in which case just skip this part. If you haven’t, I’ll do what I can to describe him, but really, you should try to meet him."
Norman Cousins,Anatomy of an Illness,1979,"This book is about a serious illness that occurred in 1964. I was reluctant to write about it for many years because I was fearful of creating false hopes in others who were similarly afflicted. Moreover, I knew that a single case has small standing in the annals of medical research, having little more than “anecdotal” or “testimonial” value."
Michael Crichton,Travels,1988,It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw.
Gavin de Becker,The Gift of Fear,1997,He had probably been watching her for a while. We aren’t sure—but what we do know is that she was not his first victim.
Louise Dean,Becoming Strangers,2004,"Before he’d had cancer he’d been bored with life. Since he’d taken dying seriously, he’d been busy; he was occupied with understanding the disease and training his body to resist it."
Joan Didion,The Year of Magical Thinking,2006,Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The question of self-pity. Those were the first words I wrote after it happened.

Nora Ephron,I Remember Nothing,2010,"I’m old. I am sixty-nine years old. Really old is eighty. But if you are young, you would definitely think I’m old. No one actually likes to admit that they’re old. The most they will cop to is that they’re older. Or oldish."
Michael J. Fox,Lucky Man,2003,"Gainesville, Florida—November 1990 I woke up to find the message in my left hand. It had me trembling. It wasn’t a fax, telegram, memo, or the usual sort of missive bringing disturbing news. In fact, my hand held nothing at all. The trembling was the message."
Ty Gagne,The Last Traverse,2020,"James Osborne is on the precipice, barely holding on to the frayed rope of advanced life support. The hospital’s technology and medications are working to protect him from falling into the abyss, but just how long the fragile anchor system can keep him aloft is uncertain."
Lisa Genova,Inside the O’Briens,2015,"Damn woman is always moving his things. He can’t kick off his boots in the living room or set his sunglasses down on the coffee table without her relocating them to “Where they belong.” Who made her God in this house? If he wants to leave a stinking pile of his own shit in the middle of the kitchen table, then that’s where it should stay until he moves it. Where the fuck is my gun? “Rosie!” Joe hollers from the bedroom."
John Green,The Fault is in Our Stars,2012,"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death."
Pete Hamill,The Drinking Life,1995,"This is a book about my time in the drinking life. It tells the story of the way one human being became aware of alcohol, embraced it, struggled with it, was hurt by it, and finally left it behind. The tale has no hero."
J. Patrick Henry,The Remembered Arts Journal,,Freda kept losing her husband.
Christopher Hitchens,Mortality,2012,I have more than once in my time woken up feeling like death. But nothing prepared me for the early morning in June when I came to consciousness feeling as if I were actually shackled to my own corpse.

John Irving,A Prayer for Owen Meany,1989,"I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice—not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother’s death, but because he is the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany."
Molly Ivins,,,Having breast cancer is massive amounts of no fun. First they mutilate you; then they poison you; then they burn you. I have been on blind dates better than that.
Tracy Kidder,Mountains Beyond Mountains,2003,"Six years after the fact, Dr. Paul Edward Farmer reminded me, “We met because of a beheading, of all things.”"
Wally Lamb,I Know This Much Is True,2008,"On the afternoon of October 12, 1990, my twin brother Thomas entered the Three Rivers, Connecticut Public Library, retreated to one of the rear study carrels, and prayed to God the sacrifice he was about to commit would be deemed acceptable."

Daniel J. Levitin,Successful Aging,2020,"The poet Dylan Thomas wrote that one should not go gently into that good night, that old age should burn and rage at close of day. As a younger man reading that poem, I saw futility in those words. I saw aging only as a failing: a failing of the body, of the mind, and even of the spirit."
Clancy Martin,How Not to Kill Yourself: A Portrait of the Suicidal Mind (2023),2023,The last time I tried to kill myself was in my basement with a dog leash.
Robert McCrum,Every Third Thought,2017,"No one will ever know exactly what happened inside my head on the night of 28 July 1995, but probably it went something like this. First, for reasons that remain mysterious, a surreptitious clot began to form in one of my cerebral arteries, cutting off the blood supply to the one organ in the body that, after the heart, is most greedy for blood."
Sherwin Nuland,How We Die,1993,"Every life is different from any that has gone before it, and so is every death. The uniqueness of each of us extends even to the way we die."
Meghan O’Rourke,The Invisible Kingdom,2022,"The stories we tell about illness usually have startling beginnings—the fall at the supermarket, the lump discovered in the abdomen during a routine exam, the doctor’s call. Not mine. I got sick the way Hemingway says you go broke: “gradually and then suddenly.”"
Peter Olsson,Janusian Days,2019,My passion for medicine dawns in the realm of childhood idealism and spiritual innocence. I am ten years old and picture myself as a medical missionary like Albert Schweitzer or Tom Dooley.
Randy Pausch,The Last Lecture,,"I have an engineering problem. While for the most part I’m in terrific physical shape, I have ten tumors in my liver and I have only a few months to live. I am a father of three young children, and married to the woman of my dreams. While I could easily feel sorry for myself, that wouldn’t do them, or me, any good. So, how to spend my very limited time."

Jodi Picoult,House Rules,2010,"Everywhere I look, there are signs of a struggle. The mail has been scattered all over the kitchen floor; the stools are overturned.

There’s one single faint footprint at the threshold of the living room, pointing toward the dead body of my son, Jacob."
Richard Powers,The Echo Maker,2006,"Cranes keep landing as night falls. Ribbons of them roll down, slack against the sky. They float in from all compass points, in kettles of a dozen, dropping with the dusk."
Mary Roach,Stiff,2003,"The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you."
Mary Roach,Spook,2005,"I don’t recall my mood the morning I was born, but I imagine I felt a bit out of sorts. Nothing I looked at was familiar. People were staring at me and making odd sounds and wearing incomprehensible items. Everything seemed too loud, and nothing made the slightest amount of sense."
Mary Roach,Bonk,2008,"A man sits in a room, manipulating his kneecaps. It is 1983, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Then he can put his pants back on, collect his payment, and go home with an entertaining story to tell at suppertime."
Jacqueline Rose,On Violence and On Violence Against Women,2021,"It is a truism to say that everyone knows violence when they see it, but if one thing has become clear over the past decade it is that the most prevalent, insidious forms of violence are those that cannot be seen."
Peter Schjeldahl,The New Yorker,,"Lung cancer, rampant. No surprise. I’ve smoked since I was sixteen, behind the high-school football bleachers in Northfield, Minnesota. I used to fear the embarrassment of dying youngish, letting people natter sagely, “He smoked, you know.” But at seventy-seven I’m into the actuarial zone."

Benjamin Spock,The Common Sense of Baby and Child Care,1946,You know more than you think you do.
Sharon Stone,The Beauty of Living Twice,2021,"I opened my eyes, and there he was standing over me, just inches from my face. A stranger looking at me with so much kindness that I was sure I was going to die. He was stroking my head, my hair; God, he was handsome. I wished he were someone who loved me instead of someone whose next words were “You’re bleeding into your brain.”"
Cheryl Strayed,The Torch,2005,"She ached. As if her spine were a zipper and someone had come up behind her and unzipped it and pushed his hands into her organs and squeezed, as if they were butter or dough, or grapes to be smashed for wine. At other times it was something sharp like diamonds or shards of glass engraving her bones."
William Styron,Darkness Visible,1990,"In Paris on a chilly evening late in October of 1985, I first became aware that the struggle with the disorder in my mind—a struggle which had engaged me for several months—might have a fatal outcome."
Elizabeth Vargas,Between Breaths,2016,"I don’t know if I was born an alcoholic, but I was definitely born anxious. The alcoholism came to me later in life, after years of drinking to ease stress and worry, and to fend off panic."
Jim Wahlberg,The Big Hustle,2020,"I’d been in fights all my life. I’d been pummeled by the toughest guys you’d ever not want to meet.

But far and away the worst gut punch I ever took was when I discovered that my son was on drugs."
David Waltner-Toews,On Pandemics,,"Until a few years ago, many scientists had banished words like “threat” and “danger” from our vocabulary. In an attempt to be more rigorously quantitative and less emotional, we began to write about risks. Our response to danger was called “risk management.”"

Ty Gagne,The Last Traverse,2020,"James Osborne is on the precipice, barely holding on to the frayed rope of advanced life support. The hospital’s technology and medications are working to protect him from falling into the abyss, but just how long the fragile anchor system can keep him aloft is uncertain."
Jason Gay,The Wall Street Journal,,"It was like watching a beloved but untrustworthy old truck, 270,000 miles on the odometer, tank near empty, bed rusted, bumper hanging, tires balding, snorting smoke, sputtering oil, conking out five times on the way home—somehow rumbling up the driveway and safely wheezing its way into the garage. In other words: beautiful."
Wayne Gretzky,Gretzky,,"I have to admit, my childhood was a little different."
Laura Hillenbrand,Seabiscuit,2001,"In 1938, near the end of a decade of monumental turmoil, the year’s number-one newsmaker was not Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Hitler, or Mussolini. It wasn’t Pope Pius XI, nor was it Lou Gehrig, Howard Hughes, or Clark Gable. The subject of the most newspaper column inches in 1938 wasn’t even a person. It was an undersized, crooked-legged racehorse named Seabiscuit."

Jane Leavy,Squeeze Play,1990,"Opening Day April 3 You see a lot of penises in my line of work: short ones, stubby ones, hard ones, soft ones. Circumcised and uncircumcised; laid-back and athletic."
Fran Lebowitz,Metropolitan Life,1978,"When it comes to sports I am not particularly interested. Generally speaking, I look upon them as dangerous and tiring activities performed by people with whom I share nothing except the right to trial by jury."
George Leonard,The Ultimate Athlete,1974,"In every fat man, the saying goes, there is a thin man struggling to get out. If this is so, then every skinny man must at times find himself surrounded by the ghostly outlines of muscles and heft.

Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I have been bird hunting since I was ten years old.

Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I concede that “mutton snapper” is hardly a prepossessing title. The sheep, from which the name derives, is not much of an animal. No civilized person deals with him except in chops and stews. To bleat is not to sing out in a commanding baritone; to be sheepish is scarcely to possess a virtue for which civilization rolls out its more impressive carpets."
Dave Meggyesy,Out of Their League,1970,"You may not know it, but you’ve probably seen me on television a few times during the last seven years or so—that is if you’re one of the 25 million Americans who zeroes in on pro football for several hours every fall weekend. I wasn’t a glamour player, and the St. Louis Cardinals, where I played linebacker, wasn’t a glamour team; but I was out there, along with a thousand or so other guys, most of them as anonymous as me. But you won’t see me out there again."
Joe Namath,All the Way,2019,"Something isn’t right. My chest is tight, and I’m just distracted, man, distracted.

Althea!”"
Robert Peterson,Only the Ball Was White,1970,"They were saints and sinners, college professors and illiterates, serious men and clowns, teetotalers and Saturday night drunks.

Walter “Red” Smith,New York Herald-Tribune,,"Now it is done. Now the story ends. And there is no way to tell it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible again."
Wright Thompson,ESPN.com,,"Pat Conroy’s dad hit him after games. He hit him with fists, and with open palms, hit him until blood ran from Pat’s nose or lip onto his basketball jersey. Don Conroy didn’t hit his son only after games. He hit him for smiling at the wrong time, talking at the wrong time, crying at the wrong time, for trying to defend his battered mother at the wrong time. On occasion, he hit him just for the hell of it."

William Zinsser,Spring Training,1989,"This book was born, though I didn’t know it at the time, seven years ago in Winter Haven, Florida, at the spring training camp of the Boston Red Sox. I was sitting in the grandstand in a sea of codgers, codging the time away."
Jane Addams,Twenty Years at Hull House,1910,"On the theory that our genuine impulses may be connected with our childish experiences, that one’s bent may be tracked back to that “No-Man’s Land” where character is formless but nevertheless settling into lines of future development, I begin this record with some impressions of my childhood."

Mitch Albom,Tuesdays with Morrie,1997,"The last class of my old professor’s life took place once a week in his house, by a window in the study where he could watch a small hibiscus plant shed its pink leaves.

Karé Anderson,Mutuality Matters,2018,"After winning several music awards one year, Carlos Santana was asked by an eager young entertainment reporter how he felt about “this belated recognition after so many years as a professional musician.” In an apparent non sequitur, Santana smiled warmly and replied, “I am becoming the people I love,” to which the reporter responded, “But what does that have to do with these awards?”"

Joan Baez,And a Voice to Sing With,1987,"I was born gifted. I can speak of my gifts with little or no modesty, but with tremendous gratitude, precisely because they are gifts, and not things which I created, or actions about which I might be proud."
Julian Baggini,What’s It All About?,2005,"“You’re T. S. Eliot,” said a taxi driver to the famous poet as he stepped into his cab. Eliot asked him how he knew. “Ah, I’ve got an eye for a celebrity,” he replied. “Only the other evening I picked up Bertrand Russell, and I said to him, ‘Well, Lord Russell, what’s it all about?’ And do you know he couldn’t tell me.’”"

Sven Birkets,Los Angeles Review of Books,,"Teaching writing, unlike most other kinds of teaching, is an intervention, closer to therapy than to any transmissible instruction."
Avery Bishop,Girl Gone Mad,2020,"The girl cut herself. With a knife, most likely—with a paring knife or steak knife pilfered from the kitchen when her parents weren’t around—or maybe she used a pair of scissors already in her bedroom, opening them up and then pressing the tip of one of the blades against her skin."
Erin Blakemore,The Heroine’s Bookshelf,2010,"In times of struggle, there are as many reasons not to read as there are to breathe. Don’t you have better things to do? Reading, let alone rereading, is the terrain of milquetoasts and mopey spinsters. At life’s ugliest junctures, the very act of opening a book can smack of cowardly escapism. Who chooses to read when there’s work to be done?"

Laurel Braitman,What Looks Like Bravery,2023,"Santa Paula, California, September 1994 It was a warm Saturday afternoon and the Santa Ana winds ruffled the tops of the avocado trees.

Rutger Bregman,Humankind,2019,"This is a book about a radical idea. An idea that’s long been known to make rulers nervous. An idea denied by religions and ideologies, ignored by the news media and erased from the annals of world history. At the same time, it’s an idea that’s legitimized by virtually every branch of science. One that’s corroborated by evolution and confirmed by everyday life. An ideal so intrinsic to human nature that it goes unnoticed and gets overlooked. If only we had the courage to take it more seriously, it’s an idea that might just start a revolution. Turn society on its head. Because once you grasp what it really means, it’s nothing less than a mind-bending drug that ensures you’ll never look at the world the same again. So what is this radical idea? That most people, deep down, are pretty decent."

Norman Cousins,Anatomy of an Illness,1979,"This book is about a serious illness that occurred in 1964.

Loads of men. Men of every conceivable shape, size, and type. In my work as a call girl, I have seen them at their most cocksure and at their most vulnerable.

Betty Friedan,The Feminine Mystique,1963,"The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women.

David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"To some philosophers it appears [a] matter of surprise that all mankind, possessing the same nature and being endowed with the same faculties, should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations, and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by the other."

Wally Lamb,I Know This Much Is True,2008,"On the afternoon of October 12, 1990, my twin brother Thomas entered the Three Rivers, Connecticut Public Library, retreated to one of the rear study carrels, and prayed to God the sacrifice he was about to commit would be deemed acceptable."

Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib. After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp.

He kneels on the floor before me, his body tense as the strings on the shamisen I used to play. “The fighting was close today,” I say to him. The soldier looks frightened—they all do.

In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees.

I had worked for an hour or two and perused the pages of old books. I had had pains for two hours, as elderly people do. I had taken a powder and been very glad when the pains consented to disappear. I had lain in a hot bath and absorbed its kindly warmth. Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour’s walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky. That was very delightful. So was the reading of old books. So was the lying in the warm bath."

Mary Karr,Cherry,2000,"No road offers more mystery than that first one you mount from the town you were born to, the first time you mount it of your own volition, on a trip funded by your own coffee tin of wrinkled up dollars—bills you’ve saved and scrounged for, worked the all-night switchboard for, missed the Rolling Stones for, sold fragrant pot with smashed flowers going brown inside twist-tie plastic baggies for.

Alicia Keyes,More Myself,,"I am seven. My mom and I are side by side in the back seat of a yellow taxi, making our way up Eleventh Avenue in Manhattan on a dead-cold day in December. We hardly ever take cabs. They’re a luxury for a single parent and part-time actress.

She was standing at the kitchen sink sponging tomato sauce off a white plate. She rinsed it and set it dripping in the dish drainer, then picked up a wineglass and scrubbed at a haze of lip gloss biting the rim.

The sky is a milky blue above us; no vegetation grows this far up so it is just me and him, the stones and the still black water. He straddles the narrow track with both booted feet and he smiles. I realize several things. That I passed him earlier, farther down the glen. We greeted each other, in the amiable yet brief manner of those on a country walk. That, on this remote stretch of path, there is no one near enough to hear me call. That he has been waiting for me: he has planned this whole thing, carefully, meticulously, and I have walked into his trap. I see all this, in an instant"

I imagined the day her fairy hair was long enough to capture in pigtails, her nose pressed to the glass of a school bus window; I saw her first crush, prom dress, heartbreak. Each vision was a bead on a rosary of future memories; I prayed daily. As it turned out, I was not a zealot…only a martyr. When I gave birth, and the doctor announced the baby’s sex, I did not believe it at first. I had done such a stellar job of convincing myself of what I wanted that I completely forgot what I needed.

Like most love stories, it also has its moments of melodrama, of emotions run amok, of suspicions, worries, anxieties, of pride and panic—of jealousy even. And, like many familiar love stories, it has times of great pleasure and bliss, only to end, because fate or the gods willed it, cataclysmically. In this case, the object of my love was not a woman. It was a small, rectangular piece of land in the south of France. This is the story of my garden."

I certainly didn’t think it would come out like this. Not in a flash. But there it was. Some of my tears streamed over the arc of my cheeks and off the rim of my jaw.

It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone.

He was a little conceited about these supposed special abilities, and that was how the story began."

Lauren Kate,The Betrayal of Natalie Hargrove,2009,"Once upon a time you knew nothing. It wasn’t your fault—you were just a kid.

Piper Kerman,Orange is the New Black,2010,"International baggage claim in the Brussels airport was large and airy, with multiple carousels circling endlessly.

Stephanie LaCava,An Extraordinary Theory of Objects,2012,I was always strange.

Harper Lee,To Kill a Mockingbird,1961,"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury.

I know what comes next as surely as I know the Mississippi rolls down to the sea. The weeping passes, and rage takes hold. The rage burns out, and blame begins. The blame bounces back and forth, and promises are made. The promises wither, and complacency returns. And the complacency stays. It stagnates like a lullaby on autoplay, until another man dies facedown on another street in another city, and the weeping begins again."

She was standing at the kitchen sink sponging tomato sauce off a white plate. She rinsed it and set it dripping in the dish drainer, then picked up a wineglass and scrubbed at a haze of lip gloss biting the rim.

I wandered the aisles of department stores, touching doll-size dresses and tiny sequined shoes. I pictured us with matching nail polish—me, who’d never had a manicure in my life. I imagined the day her fairy hair was long enough to capture in pigtails, her nose pressed to the glass of a school bus window; I saw her first crush, prom dress, heartbreak. Each vision was a bead on a rosary of future memories; I prayed daily. As it turned out, I was not a zealot…only a martyr. When I gave birth, and the doctor announced the baby’s sex, I did not believe it at first. I had done such a stellar job of convincing myself of what I wanted that I completely forgot what I needed.

Anne Tyler,The Clock Winder,1972,"The house had outlived its usefulness. It sat hooded and silent, a brown shingleboard monstrosity close to the road but backed by woods, far enough from downtown Baltimore to escape the ashy smell of the factories. The uppermost windows were shuttered: the wrap-around veranda, with its shiny gray floorboards and sky-blue ceiling, remained empty even when neighbors’ porches filled up with children and dogs and drop-in visitors.

Rachel Yoder,Nightbitch: A Novel,2021,"When she had referred to herself as Nightbitch, she meant it as a good-natured self-deprecating joke—because that’s the sort of lady she was, a good sport, able to poke fun at herself, definitely not uptight, not wound really tight, not so freakishly tight that she couldn’t see the humor in a light-hearted not-meant-as-an-insult situation—but in the days following this new naming, she found the patch of coarse black hair sprouting from the base of her neck and was, like, What the fuck."

Kobo Abe,The Ark Sakura,1984,"Once a month I go shopping downtown, near the prefectural offices. It takes me the better part of an hour to drive there, but since my purchases include a lot of specialized items—faucet packing, spare blades for power tools, large laminated dry cells, that sort of thing—the local shops won’t do.

I have to admit this from the outset or else the story I’m going to tell will make no sense."
André Aciman,Eight White Nights,2010,"Halfway through dinner, I knew I’d play the whole evening in reverse—the bus, the snow, the walk up the tiny incline, the cathedral looming straight before me, the stranger in the elevator, the crowded large living room where candlelit faces beamed with laughter and premonition, the piano music, the singer with the throaty voice, the scent of pinewood everywhere as I wandered from room to room, thinking that perhaps I should have arrived much earlier tonight, or a bit later, or that I shouldn’t have come at all, the classic sepia etchings on the wall by the bathroom where a swinging door opened to a long corridor to private areas not intended for guests but took another turn toward the hallway and then, by miracle, led back into the same living room, where more people had gathered, and where, turning to me by the window where I thought I’d found a quiet spot behind the large Christmas tree, someone suddenly put out a hand and said, “I am Clara.“"

Mitch Albom,For One More Day,2006,"“Let me guess. You want to know why I tried to kill myself.“ — Chick Benetto’s first words to me.

Nelson Algren,The Man with the Golden Arm,1949,"The captain never drank. Yet, toward nightfall in that smoke-colored season between Indian summer and December’s first true snow, he would sometimes feel half drunken.

Nelson Algren,A Walk on the Wild Side,1956,"“He’s just a pore lonesome wife-left feller,“ the more understanding said of Fitz Linkhorn, “losing his old lady is what crazied him.“ “That man is so contrary,“ the less understanding said, “if you throwed him in the river he’d float upstream.“ For what had embittered him Fitz had no name. Yet he felt that every daybreak duped him into waking and every evening conned him into sleep. The feeling of having been cheated—of having been cheated—that was it. Nobody knew why nor by whom."
Isabel Allende,The Wind Knows My Name,2023,"Vienna, November 1938 A sense of misfortune hung in the air. From the early morning hours, a menacing breeze had swept through the streets, whistling between the buildings, forcing its way in through the cracks under doors and windows. “Just winter settling in,” Rudolph Adler murmured to himself in an attempt to lighten his mood.

It was a little after dawn on the twenty-first of March 1981 when Randall Pritchard torqued his Triumph Bonneville off the 101 interchange southeast of Silverlake. The seventeen-year-old girl behind him gave a terrified howl as she flew off the back of the motorcycle, cartwheeled twice, and slammed facedown on the pavement, breaking both wrists and four front teeth and going mercifully unconscious. Randall never made a sound. He simply followed the bike’s trajectory, over the railing toward the sunrise, his long hair shining in the pink-gold glow and his arms outstretched to meet the rusty spokes of the construction barrier at the base of the concrete pilings. A skinny, pockmarked teenager from Inglewood was crouched nearby, rummaging through a stolen backpack. He saw Randall hit the barrier, the dust and rock that rose in a cloud, the blood that soaked Randall’s blue cotton shirt. “’Delia,’“ the boy told reporters later. “The man just whispered ’Delia’ and died.“"

Margaret Atwood,Cat's Eye,1988,"Time is not a line but a dimension, like the dimensions of space. If you can bend space you can bend time also, and if you knew enough and could move faster than light you could travel backward in time and exist in two places at once."
Margaret Atwood,The Blind Assassin,2000,"Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge. The bridge was being repaired: she went right through the Danger sign.

Chunks of the bridge fell on top of it. Nothing much was left of her but charred smithereens."
Margaret Atwood,Oryx and Crake,2003,"Snowman wakes before dawn. He lies unmoving, listening to the tide come in, wave after wave sloshing over the various barricades, wish-wash, wish-wash, the rhythm of heartbeat. He would so like to believe he is still asleep."
Margaret Atwood,The Heart Goes Last,2015,"Sleeping in the car is cramped. Being a third-hand Honda, it's no palace to begin with. If it was a van they'd have more room, but fat chance of affording one of those, even back when they thought they had money.

James Baldwin,Another Country,1962,"He was facing Seventh Avenue, at Times Square. It was past midnight and he had been sitting in the movies, in the top row of the balcony, since two o’clock in the afternoon.

John Barth,The Sot-Weed Factor,1960,"In the last years of the Seventeenth Century there was to be found among the fops and fools of the London coffee-houses one rangy, gangling flitch called Ebenezer Cooke, more ambitious than talented, and yet more talented than prudent, who, like his friends-in-folly, all of whom were supposed to be educating at Oxford or Cambridge, had found the sound of Mother English more fun to game with than her sense to labor over, and so rather than applying himself to the pains of scholarship, had learned the knack of versifying, and ground out quires of couplets after the fashion of the day, afroth with Joves and Jupiters, aclang with jarring rhymes, and string-taut with similes stretched to the snapping-point."
Bruce Barton,The Man Nobody Knows,1952,"It was very late in the afternoon. If you would like to learn the measure of a man that is the time of day to watch him. We are all half an inch taller in the morning than at night; it is fairly easy to take a large view of things when the mind is rested and the nerves are calm. But the day is a steady drain of small annoyances, and the difference in the size of men becomes hourly more apparent. The little man loses his temper; the big man takes a firmer hold. It was very late in the afternoon in Galilee."
L. Frank Baum,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1900,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner."
Henry N. Beard and Douglas C. Kenney,Bored of the Rings,1969,"""Do you like what you doth see...?"" said the voluptuous elf-maiden as she provocatively parted the folds of her robe to reveal the rounded, shadowy glories within. Frito's throat was dry, though his head reeled with desire and ale."

Saul Bellow,Humboldt’s Gift,1975,"The book of ballads published by Von Humboldt Fleisher in the Thirties was an immediate hit. Humboldt was just what everyone had been waiting for.

The guy had it all."
Marie Benedict,The Other Einstein,2016,"October 20, 1896 Zürich, Switzerland I smoothed the wrinkles on my freshly pressed white blouse, flattened the bow encircling my collar, and tucked back a stray hair into my tightly wound chignon.

From the prisoners’ hold they take me through the gallery, down the stairs and past the table crawling with barristers and clerks.

Once upon a time there was a piece of wood. It was not an expensive piece of wood. Far from it. Just a common block of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm. I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter. His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry. As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy. Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself: “This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of a table.” He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood. But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone: “Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!”"

I’ve always thought the secret of dealing with death was to keep it at arm’s length. That’s the rule. Don’t let it breathe in your face. But my rule didn’t protect me."
Barnaby Conrad,La Fiesta Brava,1953,"On August 27, 1947, a multimillionaire and a bull killed each other in Linares, Spain, and plunged an entire nation into deep mourning.

Roald Dahl,Matilda,1988,"It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers.

Louis de Bernières,The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman,1992,"Once again, Cardinal Dominic Trujillo Guzman felt a pang like that of childbirth spear him in the belly, and he doubled over, clutching himself and moaning.

Louis de Bernières,A Partisan’s Daughter,2008,"I am not the sort of man who goes to prostitutes. Well, I suppose that every man would say that. People would disbelieve it just because you had to say it. It’s a self-defeating statement. If I had any sense I’d delete it and start again, but I’m thinking, “My wife’s dead, my daughter’s in New Zealand, I’m in bad health, and I’m past caring, and who’s paying any attention? And in any case, it’s true.“"

Charles Dickens,Nicholas Nickleby,1838,"There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr. Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn had taken him for the same reason.

Charles Dickens,Dombey And Son,1848,"Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead, carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin, and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new."

Charles Dickens,A Tale of Two Cities,1859,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only."

Laurie Ezpeleta,Buried Mistakes,2014,"That night I dreamed. Someone’s at the door. I don’t want to open it. But I must. A young soldier stands before me, trembling.

He kneels on the floor before me, his body tense as the strings on the shamisen I used to play. “The fighting was close today,” I say to him. The soldier looks frightened—they all do. He nods and bows his head. But I have already looked into his eyes—eyes that have seen too much. He reaches for me and I flinch. It’s a mistake. His eyes flash as the wounded beast within him roars.

Peter Gault,Goldenrod,1984,I never tire of looking at myself.
Lisa Genova,Inside the O’Briens,2015,"Damn woman is always moving his things. He can’t kick off his boots in the living room or set his sunglasses down on the coffee table without her relocating them to “Where they belong.” Who made her God in this house?

I had lain in a hot bath and absorbed its kindly warmth. Three times the mail had come with undesired letters and circulars to look through. I had done my breathing exercises, but found it convenient today to omit the thought exercises. I had been for an hour’s walk and seen the loveliest feathery cloud patterns penciled against the sky.

Suddenly Annie jerks taut in my arms and points into the crowd. “Daddy! I saw Mama! Hurry!” I do not look. I don’t ask where. I don’t because Annie’s mother died seven months ago.

But Allan Karlsson had never been given to pondering things too long. So the idea had barely taken hold in the old man’s head before he opened the window of his room on the ground floor of the Old Folks’ Home in the town of Malmköping, and stepped out—into the flower bed. This maneuver required a bit of effort, since Allan was 100 years old, on this very day in fact. There was less than an hour to go before his birthday party would begin in the lounge of the Old Folks’ Home. The mayor would be there. And the local paper. And all the other old people.

Louise Penny,The Brutal Telling,2009,“All of them? Even the children?” The fireplace sputtered and crackled and swallowed his gasp. “Slaughtered?” “Worse.” There was silence then. And in that hush lived all the things that could be worse than slaughter.
Louise Penny,Bury Your Dead,2010,"Up the stairs they raced, taking them two at a time, trying to be as quiet as possible. Gamache struggled to keep his breathing steady, as though he was sitting at home, as though he had not a care in the world."
Walker Percy,The Moviegoer,1961,"This morning I got a note from my aunt asking me to come for lunch. I know what this means. Since I go there every Sunday for dinner and today is Wednesday, it can mean only one thing: she wants to have one of her serious talks."
Walker Percy,Lancelot,1977,Come into my cell. Make yourself at home. Take the chair; I’ll sit on the cot. No? You prefer to stand by the window? I understand. You like my little view. Have you noticed that the narrower the view the more you can see. For the first time I understand how old ladies can sit on their porches for years.
Arturo Pérez-Reverte,The Club Dumas,2003,"The flash projected the outline of the hanged man onto the wall. He hung motionless from a light fixture in the center of the room, and as the photographer moved around him, taking pictures, the flashes threw the silhouette onto a succession of paintings, glass cabinets full of porcelain, shelves of books, open curtains framing great windows beyond which the rain was falling."

Jodi Picoult and Jennifer Finney Boylan,Mad Honey,2022,"From the moment I was having a baby, I wanted it to be a girl. I wandered the aisles of department stores, touching doll-size dresses and tiny sequined shoes. I pictured us with matching nail polish—me, who’d never had a manicure in my life. I imagined the day her fairy hair was long enough to capture in pigtails, her nose pressed to the glass of a school bus window; I saw her first crush, prom dress, heartbreak. Each vision was a bead on a rosary of future memories; I prayed daily. As it turned out, I was not a zealot…only a martyr. When I gave birth, and the doctor announced the baby’s sex, I did not believe it at first. I had done such a stellar job of convincing myself of what I wanted that I completely forgot what I needed. But when I held Asher, slippery as a minnow, I was relieved. Better to have a boy, who would never be someone’s victim."

Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings,The Secret River,1955,There is a dark forest far away in Florida. The trees are so tall the sky is like a blue veil over their leafy hair. There is a path through the forest. It leads to the home of Calpurnia and Buggy-horse.

Kathy Reichs,Fatal Voyage,2001,I stared at the woman flying through the trees.
Erich Maria Remarque,All Quiet on the Western Front,1928,"This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it.

Fleetwood knew what that meant, that he was really forty-nine per cent sure, but he didn’t attach much weight to what Spenser said anyway. For his own part he didn’t believe the gun was real.

J. K. Rowling,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,1999,"Harry Potter was a very unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year.

Rafael Sabatini,Captain Blood,1922,"Peter Blood, bachelor of medicine and several other things besides, smoked a pipe and tended the geraniums boxed on the sill of his window above Water Lane in the town of Bridgewater.

Carl Sagan,Contact,1985,"When they pulled her out, she was not crying at all. Her tiny brow was wrinkled, and then her eyes grew wide. She looked at the bright lights, the white-and green-clad figures, the woman lying on the table below her. Somehow familiar sounds washed over her.

Françoise Sagan,A Fleeting Sorrow,1994,"“I take it you’ve been smoking for a long time.” “I’m a smoker,” Paul corrected, refusing to disown by a miserable change of tense a habit that was as ingrained in him as it was pleasurable –even if it were to cost him his life. That this detestable little doctor had just had the gall to inform him that he had only a short time to live was already bad enough."
J. D. Salinger,The Catcher in the Rye,1951,"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth."
Felix Salten,Bambi,1928,"He came into the world in the middle of the thicket, in one of those little, hidden forest glades which seem to be entirely open, but are really screened in on all sides. There was very little room in it, scarcely enough for him and his mother."
José Saramago,Cain,2009,"When the lord, also known as god, realized that adam and eve, although perfect in every outward aspect, could not utter a word or make even the most primitive of sounds, he must have felt annoyed with himself, for there was no one else in the garden of eden whom he could blame for this grave oversight, after all, the other animals, who were, like the two humans, the product of his divine command, already had a voice of their own, be it a bellow, a roar, a croak, a chirp, a whistle or a cackle."

George Saunders,Lincoln in the Bardo,2017,"On our wedding day I was forty-six, she was eighteen.

That is exactly what I refused to do, you see."
Sam Savage,Firmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife,2006,"I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov’s “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins”; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy’s “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier: “This is the saddest story I have ever heard.” I’ve read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off. Ford Madox Ford was a Big One."
Dorothy L. Sayers,Have His Carcase,1932,"The best remedy for a bruised heart is not, as so many people seem to think, repose upon a manly bosom. Much more efficacious are honest work, physical activity, and the sudden acquisition of wealth."

John Scalzi,Redshirts,2012,"From the top of the large boulder he sat on, Ensign Tom Davis looked across the expanse of the cave toward Captain Lucius Abernathy, Science Officer Q’eeng and Chief Engineer Paul West perched on a second, larger boulder and thought, Well, this sucks."

Erica Lorraine Scheit,Uses for Boys,2013,"In the happy times, in the tell-me-again times, when I’m seven and there are no stepbrothers and it’s before the stepfathers, my mom lets me sleep in her bed. Her bed is a raft on the ocean. It’s a cloud, a forest, a spaceship, a cocoon we share. I stretch out big as I can, a five-pointed star, and she bundles me back up in her arms. When I wake I’m tangled in her hair. “Tell me again,” I say and she tells me again how she wanted me more than anything. “More than anything in the world,” she says, “I wanted a little girl.”"

Anna Sewell,Black Beauty,1877,"The first place that I can well remember was a pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook, overhung by a steep bank."

Laurence Shames,Nacho Unleashed,2019,"So it was just another gorgeous day in Key West, sunny, mostly quiet though with a steady background hum of people doing stuff, having fun. Popping beer cans, revving scooter engines, singing along with the radio, that sort of thing. Harmless, goofy, peaceful stuff. No hint whatsoever that, before this day was over, it would turn into a life and death adventure of which I would be the unlikely hero. But we’ll get to that."
Laurence Shames,The Paradise Gig,2020,"Well, the whole thing started with a woman standing on her head. She was doing this yoga-style, on Smathers Beach in Key West, Florida, just a few short weeks ago. It was a beautifully ordinary day, sunny with a salty breeze. She was minding her own business, upside down, when two men suddenly approached her towel. They might have pushed her over but it’s hard to say for sure. Anyway, she came down off her head, left the beach with them, and wasn’t seen for several days. After that, a bunch of crazy stuff happened, and seemed to happen very fast."
Laurence Shames,Key West Normal,2021,Some folks say you can’t make this stuff up.
Laurence Shames,Relative Humidity,,"Now and then, not often, life offers up a perfect moment, a moment when everything just fits together, almost as if there was a plan, as if the world had been designed to be at least an occasional Paradise for those who took the trouble to notice its ingenious construction, as if life would be a calm and peaceful pleasure if that moment just went on and on. But of course it never does."

Georges Simenon,Pietr the Latvian,,"Detective Chief Inspector Maigret of the Flying Squad raised his eyes.

Andrew Smith,100 Sideways Miles,2014,"Look: I do not know where I actually came from. I wonder, I suspect, but I do not know. I am not the only one who sometimes thinks I came from the pages of a book my father wrote. Maybe it’s like that for all boys of a certain—or uncertain—age: We feel as though there are no choices we’d made through all those miles and miles behind us that hadn’t been scripted by our fathers, and that our futures are only a matter of flipping the next page that was written ahead of us. I am not the only one who’s ever been trapped inside a book."
Andrew Smith,Grasshopper Jungle,2014,"I read somewhere that human beings are genetically predisposed to record history. We believe it will prevent us from doing stupid things in the future. But even though we dutifully archived elaborate records of everything we’ve ever done, we also managed to keep on doing dumber and dumber shit. This is my history."

Lemony Snicket (pen name of Daniel Handler),"The Bad Beginning, or, Orphans",1999,"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.

Alexander Solzhenitsyn,One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,1962,"At five o’clock that morning reveille was sounded, as usual, by the blows of a hammer on a length of rail hanging up near the staff quarters. The intermittent sounds barely penetrated the windowpanes on which the frost lay two fingers thick, and they ended almost as soon as they’d begun. It was cold outside, and the camp guard was reluctant to go on beating out the reveille for long."

Alexander Solzhenitsyn,"The Gulag Archipelago, 1918-1956,",1973,"How do people get to this clandestine Archipelago? Hour by hour planes fly there, ships steer their course there, and trains thunder off to it—but all with nary a mark on them to tell of their destination."

Gilbert Sorrentino,Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things,1971,"What if this young woman, who writes such bad poems, in competition with her husband, whose poems are equally bad, should stretch her remarkably long and well-made legs out before you, so that her skirt slips up to the tops of her stockings?"
Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg,Candy,1958,"“I’ve read many books,” said Professor Mephesto, with an odd finality, wearily flattening his hands on the podium, addressing the seventy-six sophomores who sat in easy reverence, immortalizing his every phrase with their pads and pens, and now, as always, giving him the confidence to slowly, artfully dramatize his words, to pause, shrug, frown, gaze abstractly at the ceiling, allow a wan wistful smile to play at his lips, and repeat quietly, “many books . . .” [ellipsis in original]"
Nicholas Sparks,Dear John,2006,What does it mean to truly love another?

Mickey Spillane,One Lonely Night,1951,"Nobody ever walked across the bridge, not on a night like this. The rain was misty enough to be almost fog-like, a cold gray curtain that separated me from the pale ovals of white that were faces locked behind the steamed-up windows of the cars that hissed by. Even the brilliance that was Manhattan by night was reduced to a few sleepy, yellow lights off in the distance."
Mickey Spillane,The Big Kill,1951,It was one of those nights when the sky came down and wrapped itself around the world. The rain clawed at the windows of the bar like an angry cat and tried to sneak in every time some drunk lurched in the door. The place reeked of stale beer and soggy men with enough cheap perfume thrown in to make you sick.
Francis Spufford,Cahokia Jazz,2024,"With the building dark beneath it, the skylight on the roof of the Land Trust was a pyramid of pure black. Down the smooth black of the glass, something sticky had run, black on black, all the way down into the crust of soft spring snow at Barrow’s feet, where it puddled in sunken loops and pools like molasses. On top, a contorted mass was somehow pinned or perched."

Garth Stein,The Art of Racing in the Rain,2008,"Gestures are all that I have; sometimes they must be grand in nature. And while I occasionally step over the line and into the world of the melodramatic, it is what I must do in order to communicate clearly and effectively. In order to make my point understood without question."
Robert Louis Stevenson,Treasure Island,1883,"Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17—and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow Inn and the brown old seaman, with the sabre cut, first took up his lodging under our roof."

Nina Stibbe,Man at the Helm,2014,My sister and I and our little brother were born (in that order) into a very good situation and apart from the odd new thing life was humdrum and comfortable until an evening in 1970 when our mother listened in to our father’s phone call and ended up blowing her nose on a tea towel—a thing she’d only have done in an absolute emergency.
Irving Stone,The Agony and the Ecstasy,1961,"He sat before the mirror of the second-floor bedroom sketching his lean cheeks with their high bone ridges, the flat broad forehead, and ears too far back on the head, the dark hair curling forward in thatches, the amber-colored eyes wide-set but heavy-lidded."

Rex Stout,Too Many Cooks,1938,"Walking up and down the platform alongside the train in the Pennsylvania Station, having wiped the sweat from my brow, I lit a cigarette with the feeling that after it had calmed my nerves a bit I would be prepared to submit bids for a contract to move the Pyramid of Cheops from Egypt to the top of the Empire State Building with my bare hands, in a swimming suit; after what I had just gone through."
Rex Stout,Too Many Women,1947,"It was the same old rigamarole. Sometimes I found it amusing; sometimes it only bored me; sometimes it gave me a pronounced pain, especially when I had more of Wolfe than was good for either of us."
Rex Stout,The Mother Hunt,1963,"When the doorbell rang a little after eleven that Tuesday morning in early June and I went to the hall and took a look through the one-way glass panel in the front door, I saw what, or whom, I expected to see; a face a little too narrow, gray eyes a little too big, and a figure a little too thin for the best curves."
Harriet Beecher Stowe,Uncle Tom’s Cabin,1852,"Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in the town of P____, in Kentucky.

Cheryl Strayed,The Torch,2005,"She ached. As if her spine were a zipper and someone had come up behind her and unzipped it and pushed his hands into her organs and squeezed, as if they were butter or dough, or grapes to be smashed for wine. At other times it was something sharp like diamonds or shards of glass engraving her bones."
Elizabeth Strout,Olive Kitteridge,2008,"For many years Henry Kitteridge was a pharmacist in the next town over, driving every morning on snowy roads, or rainy roads, or summertime roads, when the wild raspberries shot their new growth in brambles along the last section of town before he turned off to where the wider road led to the pharmacy. Retired now, he still wakes early and remembers how mornings used to be his favorite, as though the world were his secret, tires rumbling softly beneath him and the light emerging through the early fog, the brief sight of the bay off to his right, then the pines, tall and slender, and almost always he rode with the window partly open because he loved the smell of the pines and the heavy salt air, and in the winter he loved the smell of the cold."
William Styron,Sophie’s Choice,1979,"In those days cheap apartments were almost impossible to find in Manhattan, so I had to move to Brooklyn. This was in 1947, and one of the pleasant features of that summer which I so vividly remember was the weather, which was sunny and mild, flower-fragrant, almost as if the days had been arrested in a seemingly perpetual springtime. I was grateful for that if for nothing else, since my youth, I felt, was at its lowest ebb."
Faith Sullivan,"Repent, Lanny Merkel",1981,"Like innumerable other mid-life women who suffer from insecurity, paranoia, grave misgivings, vague longings, and obvious shortcomings, I’m basically a happy person."

It continues for an uncomfortable time....)"
Walter Tevis,The Hustler,1959,"Henry, black and stooped, unlocked the door with a key on a large metal ring. He had just come up in the elevator. It was nine o’clock in the morning. The door was a massive thing, a great ornate slab of oak, stained once to look like mahogany, ebony now from sixty years of smoke and dirt. He pushed the door open, shoved the door stop in place with his lame foot, and limped in. There was no need to turn the lights on, for in the morning the three huge windows along the side wall faced the rising sun. Outside of them was much daylight, much of downtown Chicago. Henry pulled the cord that parted the heavy draperies and these gathered in grimy elegance to the edges of the windows. Outside was a panorama of gray buildings; between them, patches of a virginal blue sky. Then he opened the windows, a few inches from the bottom. Air puffed abruptly and small eddies of dust and the aftermaths of four-hour-old cigarette smoke whirled and then began to dissipate. Always by afternoon the draperies would be drawn tight, the windows shut; only in the morning was the tobaccoed air exchanged for fresh. A poolroom in the morning is a strange place."
Walter Tevis,The Man Who Fell to Earth,1963,"After two miles of walking he came to a town. At the town’s edge was a sign that read Haneyville: Pop. 1400. That was good, a good size. It was still early in the morning—he had chosen morning for the two-mile walk, because it was cooler then—and there was no one yet in the streets. He walked for several blocks in the weak light, confused at the strangeness—tense and somewhat frightened. He tried not to think of what he was going to do. He had thought about it enough already. In the small business district he found what he wanted, a tiny store called The Jewel Box. On the street corner nearby was a green wooden bench, and he went to it and seated himself, his body aching from the labor of the long walk. It was a few minutes later that he saw a human being."

Josephine Tey,To Love and Be Wise,1951,"Grant paused with his foot on the lowest step, and listened to the shrieking from the floor above. As well as the shrieks there was a dull continuous roar; an elemental sound, like a forest fire or a river in spate. As his reluctant legs bore him upwards he arrived at the inevitable deduction: the party was being a success."
Josephine Tey,The Daughter of Time,1951,Grant lay on his high white cot and stared at the ceiling. Stared at it with loathing. He knew by heart every last minute crack on its nice clean surface.

Angie Thomas,Concrete Rose,2021,"When it comes to the streets, there’s rules. They ain’t written down, and you won’t find them in a book. It’s natural stuff you know the moment your momma let you out the house. Kinda like you know how to breathe without somebody telling you."

Rufi Thorpe,Margo’s Got Money Troubles,2024,"You are about to begin reading a new book, and to be honest, you are a little tense. The beginning of a novel is like a first date.

John Kennedy Toole,A Confederacy of Dunces,1980,"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress."
Jean Toomer,Cane,1923,"Men had always wanted her, this Karintha, even as a child, Karintha carrying beauty, perfect as dusk when the sun goes down."

Anthony Trollope,Linda Tressel,1868,"The troubles and sorrows of Linda Tressel, who is the heroine of the little story now about to be told, arose from the too rigid virtue of her nearest and most loving friend—as troubles will sometimes come from rigid virtue when rigid virtue is not accompanied by sound sense, and especially when it knows little or nothing of the softness of mercy."

Mark Twain,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,1884,"You don’t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by a Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.”"

Anne Tyler,The Clock Winder,1972,"The house had outlived its usefulness. It sat hooded and silent, a brown shingleboard monstrosity close to the road but backed by woods, far enough from downtown Baltimore to escape the ashy smell of the factories. The uppermost windows were shuttered: the wrap-around veranda, with its shiny gray floorboards and sky-blue ceiling, remained empty even when neighbors’ porches filled up with children and dogs and drop-in visitors. Yet clearly someone still lived there. A loaded bird-feeder hung in the dogwood tree. And in the side yard, Richard the handyman stood peeing against a rosebush with his profile to the house and his long black face dreamy and distant."
Anne Tyler,Celestial Navigation,1974,"My brother Jeremy is a thirty-eight-year-old bachelor who never did leave home.

Anne Tyler,Noah’s Compass,2009,"In the sixty-first year of his life, Liam Pennywell lost his job. It wasn’t such a good job, anyhow. He’d been teaching fifth grade in a second-rate private boys’ school. Fifth grade wasn’t even what he’d been trained for. Teaching wasn’t what he’d been trained for. His degree was in philosophy. Oh, don’t ask. Things seemed to have taken a downward turn a long time ago…."

John Updike,"Rabbit, Run",1960,"Boys are playing basketball around a telephone pole with a backboard bolted to it. Legs, shouts.

John Updike,Rabbit at Rest,1990,"Standing amid the tan, excited post-Christmas crowd at the Southwest Florida Regional Airport, Rabbit Angstrom has a funny sudden feeling that what he has come to meet, what’s floating in unseen about to land, is not his son Nelson and daughter-in-law Pru and their two children but something more ominous and intimately his: his own death, shaped vaguely like an airplane."
Mario Vargas Llosa,Conversation in the Cathedral,1969,"From the doorway of La Crónica Santiago looks at the Avenida Tacna without love: cars, uneven and faded buildings, the gaudy skeletons of posters floating in the mist, the gray midday. At what precise moment had Peru fucked itself up?"

Dan Wakefield,Starting Over,1973,"Potter was lucky; everyone told him so. “You’re lucky,” they said, “that you didn’t have any children.” Divorce wasn’t any bowl of cherries, of course, but as long as there weren’t any children involved it wasn’t an irreparable damage, like the sundering of a full-blown family. Just the busted dream of a couple of consenting adults. When Potter met new people and the subject of his recent divorce came up, he was congratulated so often for not having any children, he was tempted to start passing out cigars in celebration, saying heartily, “It wasn’t a boy—or a girl!”"

Robert Penn Warren,A Place to Come To,1977,"I was the only boy, or girl either, in the public school of Dugton, Claxford County, Alabama, whose father had ever got killed in the middle of the night standing up in the front of his wagon to piss on the hindquarters of one of a span of mules and, being drunk, pitching forward on his head, still hanging on to his dong, and hitting the pike in such a position and condition that both the left front and the left rear wheels of the wagon rolled, with perfect precision, over his unconscious neck, his having passed out being, no doubt, the reason he took the fatal plunge in the first place.

H. G. Wells,The War of the Worlds,1898,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were being scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water."
Martha Wells,All Systems Red,2017,"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure."

Hence why fear death.” As a physician and a psychiatrist, he had murmured these very consolations into the ears of the dying."

Fredric Brown,Thrilling Wonder Stories,1903,"There is a sweet little horror story that is only two sentences long: The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door... Two sentences and an ellipsis of three dots. The horror, of course, isn’t in the story at all; it’s in the ellipsis, the implication: what knocked at the door.

Far out in the country there was an old Negro woman with her head tied in a red rag, coming along a path through the pinewoods. Her name was Phoenix Jackson. She was very old and small and she walked slowly in the dark pine shadows, moving a little from side to side in her steps, with the balanced heaviness and lightness of a pendulum in a grandfather clock.

Down the corridors of religious history we hear this sound: Martin Luther, an energetic thirty-three-year-old Augustinian friar, hammering his Ninety-five Theses to the doors of the Castle Church of Wittenburg, in Saxony, and thus, eventually, splitting the thousand-year-old Catholic Church into two churches—one loyal to the Pope in Rome, the other protesting against the Pope’s rule and soon, in fact, calling itself Protestant."

Mortimer J. Adler,The Angels and Us,1982,"Bodies without minds—nothing unusual about that...it would not occur to anyone to think things might be otherwise. The spectacle of bodies without minds does not have the fascination of the odd or abnormal.

Roger Angell,The New Yorker,,"Check me out. The top two knuckles of my left hand look as if I’d been worked over by the K.G.B. No, it’s more as if I’d been a catcher for the Hall of Fame pitcher Candy Cummings, the inventor of the curveball, who retired from the game in 1877.

Alain Badiou,In Praise of Love,,"A philosopher must never forget the countless situations in life when he is no different from anyone else. If he does, theatrical tradition, particularly comedy, will rudely remind him of that fact."

Julian Baggini,What’s It All About?,2005,"“You’re T. S. Eliot,” said a taxi driver to the famous poet as he stepped into his cab. Eliot asked him how he knew. “Ah, I’ve got an eye for a celebrity,” he replied. “Only the other evening I picked up Bertrand Russell, and I said to him, ‘Well, Lord Russell, what’s it all about?’ And do you know he couldn’t tell me.’”"
Julian Baggini,The Edge of Reason,2016,"We have lost our reason, and our loss is no accident."
Erik Baker,N + 1,,"First there was the fire, the smoke billowing infernally into the Appalachian night. It just kept burning. Days of insatiable flame. A black pillar of fumes took up residence above the town like an inert tornado. At its heart, we learned, was the corpse of a train, fifty cars off the rails."
Russell Baker,Growing Up,1982,"At the age of eighty my mother had her last bad fall, and after that her mind wandered free through time. Some days she went to weddings and funerals that had taken place half a century earlier. On others she presided over family dinners cooked on Sunday afternoon for children who were now gray with age. Through all this she lay in bed but moved across time, traveling among the dead decades with a speed and ease beyond the gift of physical science."

David Baron,American Eclipse,2017,"To be human, it seems, is to seek purpose in our transient lives. Many people find meaning in the eyes of their children or in the words of scripture, but I discovered it on a beach outside a Hyatt Regency in Aruba."
Dave Barry,Dave Barry Talks Back,1991,"I am always getting letters from people who want my job. “Dave,” they start out.

Dave Barry,The Miami Herald,,"OK. You turned 50. You know you’re supposed to get a colonoscopy. But you haven’t. Here are your reasons: 1. You’ve been busy. 2. You don’t have a history of cancer in your family. 3. You haven’t noticed any problems. 4. You don’t want a doctor to stick a tube 17,000 feet up your butt."
Lionel Barrymore,We Barrymores,1951,"In the watches of the night when old thoughts come to roost, some of them slapping their thighs and roaring, others hiding their faces, two particularly baffling notions often appear to beleaguer me.

W. Kamau Bell,Vanity Fair,,"I am afraid of the cops. Absolutely petrified of the cops. Now understand, I’ve never been arrested or held for questioning. I’ve never been told that I “fit the description.” But that doesn’t change a thing. I am afraid of cops the way that spiders are afraid of boots. You’re walking along, minding your own business, and SQUISH! You are dead."

Greg Bellow,Saul Bellow’s Heart,2013,"On a visit to Chicago when I was eight, I witnessed a terrible argument, in Yiddish, between my father and grandfather.

After a few minutes, he excused his lapse of self-control by saying, “It’s okay for grown-ups to cry.“ I knew his heart was breaking. I knew because of the bond between my father’s tender heart and mine."

Cyril Bibby,T. H. Huxley,1959,"On the 4th of May 1825, when Thomas Henry Huxley was born in the sleepy old village of Ealing, English society still had its roots deep in the eighteenth century.

Joe Biden,Promises to Keep,2007,"Joe Impedimenta, my classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day. It was one of the first big words we learned. Impedimenta—the baggage that impedes one’s progress."
Ambrose Bierce,Write It Right,1909,"The author’s main purpose in this book is to teach precision in writing; and of good writing (which, essentially, is clear thinking made visible) precision is the point of capital concern."
Sven Birkets,Los Angeles Review of Books,,"Teaching writing, unlike most other kinds of teaching, is an intervention, closer to therapy than to any transmissible instruction."

Erin Blakemore,The Heroine’s Bookshelf,2010,"In times of struggle, there are as many reasons not to read as there are to breathe. Don’t you have better things to do? Reading, let alone rereading, is the terrain of milquetoasts and mopey spinsters. At life’s ugliest junctures, the very act of opening a book can smack of cowardly escapism. Who chooses to read when there’s work to be done?"
Karen Blixen,Out of Africa,1937,"I had a farm in Africa, at the foot of the Ngong Hills."
Kate Block,Spinster,2015,"Whom to marry, and when it will happen—these two questions define every woman’s existence, regardless of where she was raised or what religion she does or doesn’t practice. She may grow up to love women instead of men, or to decide she simply doesn’t believe in marriage. No matter. These dual contingencies govern her until they’re answered, even if the answers are nobody and never."
Lawrence Block,The Crime of Our Lives,2015,It was in the eleventh grade that I knew I would be a writer. The conviction grew out of two awarenesses that dawned at about the same time.

Charles M. Blow,Fire Shut Up in My Bones,2014,"Tears flowed out of me from a walled-off place, from another time, from a little boy who couldn’t cry. I had held on to the hurt and shame and doubt for so long, balling it up in the pit of me, that I never thought it would come out, or that it could. I certainly didn’t think it would come out like this. Not in a flash. But there it was. Some of my tears streamed over the arc of my cheeks and off the rim of my jaw. Others rounded the corners of my nose and puddled in the crease of my lips. I didn’t wipe them. I wore them. I looked over at the rusting pistol on the passenger seat. It was a .22 with a long black barrel and a wooden grip."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. That’s Euclid. Basic geometry. Only you’re smarter. It’s easy. After all, you know how the investigators work. You’re a student of cop-think.**"
Howard Blum,,,"Everybody’s looking for love, right? Love is all you need. At least that’s what they keep telling you. So why should you be any different? You have needs, too.

Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"You know how cops work. You know what they look for. You know the questions they’ll ask. You know all their tricks. You’re prepared. Well trained. After all. You’ve taken the classes. Earned the degrees. You’ve gotten into the heads of bad guys; written “crime scripts,” as your profs call them. You learned from their mistakes."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"Stepping into the courtroom, you know the score. Only one thing matters: getting your client off the hook. So if the facts are on your side, you pound ’em. If not, pound the table."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,People say time heals all wounds. They tell you you’ll get over it. But they never buried their child.
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"Suppose you wanted to kill someone. That would be easy. There are lots of ways. But suppose you wanted to kill four people. All in the same house. All within moments of one another. And you chose to use a knife. That could help eliminate the noise. But it would require skill, strength, and endurance. Murder is hard work, especially if people fight back."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,Every doctor takes the pledge: Do no harm. It’s damn good advice for any trial lawyer too.
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"Ever try dodging a bullet? That’s a challenge, all right. But suppose you need to dodge five bullets. And each of the five shooters has a long gun aimed straight at your heart. Oh, and you’re strapped tight to a chair, to boot."
Cat Bohannon,Eve,2023,"Elizabeth Shaw has a problem. The director Ridley Scott has impregnated her with a large, vicious alien squid. Aboard the spaceship Prometheus, she has to find a way to abort her uninvited guest without bleeding to death.

Rutger Bregman,Utopia for Realists,2016,Let’s start with a little history lesson: In the past everything was worse.
Rutger Bregman,Humankind,2019,"This is a book about a radical idea. An idea that’s long been known to make rulers nervous. An idea denied by religions and ideologies, ignored by the news media and erased from the annals of world history. At the same time, it’s an idea that’s legitimized by virtually every branch of science. One that’s corroborated by evolution and confirmed by everyday life. An ideal so intrinsic to human nature that it goes unnoticed and gets overlooked. If only we had the courage to take it more seriously, it’s an idea that might just start a revolution. Turn society on its head. Because once you grasp what it really means, it’s nothing less than a mind-bending drug that ensures you’ll never look at the world the same again. So what is this radical idea? That most people, deep down, are pretty decent."
Ian Bremmer,The Power of Crisis,2022,"Away from the cameras and warmed by the fire, Ronald Reagan opened his first private conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev with a startling question: “What would you do if the United States were suddenly attacked by someone from outer space? Would you help us?”"

David Brooks,How to Know a Person,2023,"If you ever saw the old movie Fiddler on the Roof, you know how warm and emotional Jewish families can be. They are always hugging, singing, dancing, laughing, and crying together. I come from the other kind of Jewish family."
Mel Brooks,All About Me!,2021,"The writing of this book serves as a kind of confession. You, the readers will be my confidants. I’m going to tell you all my secrets. Things I’ve never told anybody. Things I don’t want anybody to know! I don’t want you to breathe a word of what you find out in this book. Keep everything under your hat! Wait a minute, wait a minute…that might not work. I’m not in a confessional booth, and a lot of you are probably not priests. This is a book! And this book needs to sell!"
Heywood Broun,Pieces of Hate and Other Enthusiasms,1922,"One of my favorite characters in all fiction is D’Artagan. He was forever fighting duels with people and stabbing them, or riding at top speed over lonely roads at night to save a woman’s name or something."

Frank Bruni,The Beauty of Dusk,2022,"They say that death comes like a thief in the night. Lesser vandals have the same MO. The affliction that stole my vision, or at least a big chuck of it, did so as I slept. I went to bed seeing the world one way. I woke up seeing it another."
Frank Bruni,The New York Times,,"If the Jan. 6 rioters weren’t going to be pointing their guns at him, then he didn’t care that they were armed."
Bill Bryson,The Lost Continent,1989,I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.
Bill Bryson,The Mother Tongue,1990,"More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to. It would be charitable to say the results are sometimes mixed."

Art Buchwald,Too Soon to Say Goodbye,2006,"What started out the worst of times ended up the best of times. The big news of 2006 is that I’m still alive. After being in the hospice waiting to die, I said, “To hell with it, I’m going to write a book.”"
Christopher Buckley,Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir,2009,"I’m not sure how this book will turn out. I mostly write novels, and I’ve found, having written half a dozen, that if you’re lucky, the ending turns out a surprise and you wind up with something you hadn’t anticipated in the outline. I suppose it’s a process of outsmarting yourself (not especially hard in my case)."
Christopher Buckley,Forbes Life,2014,"My wife, in her wisdom, decreed that we must have a fish tank in our bathroom. Like Rumpole of the Bailey, I refer to my darling as She Who Must Be Obeyed. So the only answer was “Darling, what an excellent idea. I am so excited to have fish in our bathroom.”"
Christopher Buckley,Forbes Life,2014,"It’s a bit cramped in the back of the Cessna 206. The windows are frosting over, and as I scrape away the rime with the edge of a credit card what I can make out is not entirely reassuring."
Christopher Buckley,Forbes FYI,2014,"“Good to see you again,” I greeted the gentleman, a family friend, important businessman and former cabinet secretary. “How’s Carol?” The friendly grin remained, but I caught the suppressed wince. “She died three years ago,” he said.

Jimmy Buffett,A Pirate Looks at Fifty,1998,"When I was growing up in Alabama, the beginning of the new school year was a bad time. It meant the end of summer, which is my season.

Michael Caine,What’s It All About?,1992,"The first time I was in the United States, when I had just made Alfie, I was sitting on my own in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel and heard the sound of a helicopter landing in the gardens opposite. This, the porter told me, was strictly illegal. He and I stood at the door to see who was so flagrantly flouting the law—presumably the President, of the United States or at least of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Across Sunset Boulevard, out of a swirling sun-flecked cloud of dust, six foot four and in full cowboy get-up, strode the unmistakable figure of John Wayne."
Michael Caine,The Elephant to Hollywood,2010,"Well, it’s a long way from London’s Elephant and Castle to Hollywood. And the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line—as my story is going to prove. But then I’ve never been known for doing things the easy way. I wouldn’t have minded easy, but things just never worked out quite like that. In fact—although I couldn’t have known it at the time—they worked out a whole lot better."
Ilia Calderón,My Time To Speak,2020,"All my attention was focused on his face. It’s what I remember most clearly more than two years after our encounter. That face that had raged red as soon as he saw me, and continued angry, indignant. His nostrils flared with his agitated breathing, which he unsuccessfully attempted to control. He responded quickly, hot, like a lit fuse, not letting anyone else talk. And then, suddenly, I heard it from his own lips, “We’re going to burn you out.”"

Albert Camus,The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays,1942,"The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock up to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight.

Frank Capra,The Name Above the Title,1971,"I hated being poor. Hated being a peasant. Hated being a scrounging newskid trapped in the sleazy Sicilian ghetto of Los Angeles.

I looked for a device, a handle, a pole to catapult myself across the tracks from my scurvy habitat of nobodies to the affluent world of somebodies."
Mariah Carey,The Meaning of Mariah Carey,,"My intention was to keep her safe, but perhaps I have only succeeded in keeping her prisoner."
Richard Carlson,Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff…and It’s All Small Stuff,1997,"Whenever we’re dealing with bad news, a difficult person, or a disappointment of some kind, most of us get into certain habits, ways of reacting to life—particularly adversity—that don’t serve us very well."
Robert A. Caro,Master of the Senate,2002,"The room on the first floor of the Barbour County Courthouse in the little town of Eufaula, Alabama, was normally the County Clerk’s Office, but after it had closed for the day on August 2, 1957, it was being used by the county’s Board of Registrars, the body that registered citizens so they could vote in elections—not that the Board was going to register any of the three persons who were applying that day, for the skin of these applicants was black."

Rubin Carter,The Sixteenth Round,1974,"RUBIN, my Christian name, comes from the Book of Genesis, Chapter 29, verse 32 of the Holy Scriptures. Other than both of us being black, that’s about the only thing the Bible and I ever had in common."

Bennett Cerf,Try and Stop Me,1944,I have always had a hitherto useless knack for remembering hundreds of unrelated anecdotes about unrelated people. In the minds of some this has constituted me a “raconteur.”
Bennett Cerf,The Laugh’s on Me,1959,"There now are more than 175 million people, census takers tell us, in this blessed land of ours, and as I write this probably fifty million of them are telling a story. Just how well they are telling it is another matter."

Stephen Colbert,America Again,2012,I wrote another book. I hope you’re happy. Because this book is your fault.
Judy Collins,Sweet Judy Blue Eyes,2011,"It’s a Sunday night, and I am traveling from Hartford to New York City, heading in from a show. Rain pours down, and the driver of my sedan is battling the storm like a captain of a schooner in white waves. Thoughts of my life flow like the water around us: years of life, love and anger, rage and hope; the songs I have sung; the men and women I have loved."
Blayney Colmore,God Knows,2005,"From what source, one might wonder, would anyone gain the energy to write a book? Or the narcissism to think anyone would want to read it? It beats therapy."
Blayney Colmore,I Reserve the Right to be Terrified,2022,"The road was steep. But it leveled off at the bottom, so you got a nice glide before the next hill. We’d ridden that road a lot, so we let the bikes run. Last I looked at the speedometer it read between 30 and 35 miles per hour. Exhilarating. Conrad and his daughter Karen were much more experienced and stronger bikers than I was. I followed them down the hill. They both skillfully avoided the board in the road. I never saw it. He told me later that he saw me launch from my bike like a rocket. “You must have gone 20 feet in the air before you landed.” When Karen saw me lying motionless on the road, she said, “Oh God, Dad, I think he’s dead.”"
Barnaby Conrad III,Cigar Aficionado,,"The Martini is a cocktail distilled from the wink of a platinum blonde, the sweat of a polo horse, the blast of an ocean liner’s horn, the Chrysler building at sunset, a lost Cole Porter tune, and the aftershave of quipping detectives in natty double-breasted suits."

Alistair Cooke,Talk About America,1973,"It was a splendid day in Vermont when they buried Robert Frost, the sky without a cloud, the light from the white landscape making every elm and barn as sharp as a blade, and the people crunching quietly through the deep snow and squinting in the enormous sun."
Alistair Cooke,America Observed,1989,I met him first on a winter’s afternoon in what I almost slipped into calling the vestry of his suite at the Plaza Hotel in New York.
Kelly Corrigan,The Middle Place,2008,"The thing you need to know about me is that I am George Corrigan’s daughter, his only daughter. You may have met him, in which case just skip this part. If you haven’t, I’ll do what I can to describe him, but really, you should try to meet him."
Kelly Corrigan,Glitter and Glue,2013,"When I was growing up, my mom was guided by the strong belief that to befriend me was to deny me the one thing a kid really needed to survive childhood: a mother."
Maureen Corrigan,"Leave Me Alone, I’m Reading",2005,It’s not that I don’t like people. It’s just that when I’m in the company of others—even my nearest and dearest—there always comes a moment when I’d rather be reading a book.
Norman Cousins,Anatomy of an Illness,1979,"This book is about a serious illness that occurred in 1964. I was reluctant to write about it for many years because I was fearful of creating false hopes in others who were similarly afflicted. Moreover, I knew that a single case has small standing in the annals of medical research, having little more than “anecdotal” or “testimonial” value."
Norman Cousins,The Pathology of Power,1987,This book is about power—how it is perceived; how it is used; its illusions and realities; its benefits and dangers. What confronts the American people as they approach the twenty-first century is the truth of one of the best-known axioms on human behavior: “Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.”

The day I’m her age…” [ellipsis in original]"

Belle de Jour,The Further Adventures of a London Call Girl,2006,"“What I want, what I really want…this probably sounds silly…is to please you.“ The client was fiftyish, dressed office-casual.

Belle de Jour,Belle de Jour’s Guide to Men,2009,"You might be wondering what, exactly, a prostitute might have to say about men and relationships… [ellipsis in original] Let’s put it this way: I have met men. Loads of men. Men of every conceivable shape, size, and type. In my work as a call girl, I have seen them at their most cocksure and at their most vulnerable. And if this experience has taught me anything at all, it is that this odd and inscrutable species we call Man is often libelously misrepresented in the female press."
Karl De Schweinitz,The Art of Helping People Out of Trouble,1924,Living has yet to be generally recognized as one of the arts.
John Denver,Take Me Home,,"They met in Tulsa. Dad was a ploughboy from western Oklahoma; Mom was a hometown girl.

William Deresiewicz,A Jane Austen Education,2011,"I was twenty-six, and about as dumb, in all human things, as any twenty-six-year-old has a right to be, when I met the woman who would change my life. That she’d been dead for a couple of hundred years made not the slightest difference whatsoever."

Bernadette Devlin,The Price of My Soul,1969,"The Price of My Soul is not a work of art, an autobiography, or a political manifesto. Readers who expect one or other of these things will no doubt class it as a failure. Let them. I’m not basically concerned with its success, financial or literary."

Michael Dirda,An Open Book,2003,Daydreaming is my only hobby.
Michael Dirda,Classics for Pleasure,2007,"Classics for pleasure? To some readers this may seem an oxymoron. Aren’t classics supposed to be difficult, esoteric, and a little boring? Yes, teachers and critics claim they’re good for you, but so are milk of magnesia and cod-liver oil. Really, after a hard day’s work, who wants to settle down for more…work? A fast-moving thriller or a steamy romance—those sound more like it."

Peter F. Drucker,Adventures of a Bystander,1978,Bystanders have no history of their own. They are on the stage but are not part of the action. They are not even audience.

W. E. B. Du Bois,The Souls of Black Folk,1903,"Herein lie buried many things which if read with patience may show the strange meaning of being black here at the dawning of the Twentieth Century.

"Meghan, Duchess of Sessex (formerly Meghan Markle)",The New York Times,,"It was a July morning that began as ordinarily as any other day: Make breakfast. Feed the dogs. Take vitamins. Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib. After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second."

Linda Ellerbee,Move On: Adventures in the Real World,1991,"I packed up his comic books, sold off the bunk beds, gave away the last Star Wars sheet and threw out the beanbag chair that had bled to death in 1975. I tore down the six MASH posters super-glued to the wall between his room and mine."

Jacqueline Faber,Writer’s Digest,,"If the salesperson’s edict is to “always be closing,” the writer’s first mandate is to nail the opening. When it works, it feels like alchemy.

Mark Forsyth,The Elements of Eloquence,2013,"Shakespeare was not a genius. He was, without the distant shadow of a doubt, the most wonderful writer who ever breathed. But not a genius.

Michael J. Fox,Lucky Man,2003,"Gainesville, Florida—November 1990 I woke up to find the message in my left hand. It had me trembling. It wasn’t a fax, telegram, memo, or the usual sort of missive bringing disturbing news. In fact, my hand held nothing at all. The trembling was the message."

Betty Friedan,The Feminine Mystique,1963,"The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women.

Martin Gardner,The New York Times,,"Biographical history, as taught in our public schools, is still largely a history of boneheads: ridiculous kings and queens, paranoid political leaders, compulsive voyagers, ignorant generals—the flotsam and jetsam of historical currents.

"Scott L. Gardner, Judy Diamond, &amp; Gabor Racz",Parasites,2022,"Parasites are rarely described in positive terms. They are seen as blood suckers, freeloaders, scroungers, flunkies, deadbeats, and the worst kind of groupies."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"It must have been a gas, to borrow one of his favorite terms, to get a letter from Terry Southern. Each was its own little acid trip, streaked with innuendo and poached in a satirical kind of intellectual flop sweat. He used thin, expensive paper and sealed some of his letters with wax. People were said to read them aloud to whoever was in the room."

Richard Goodman,French Dirt,,"This is a love story. Like most love stories. it has its share of joy and passion, of loss and pain. Like most love stories, it also has its moments of melodrama, of emotions run amok, of suspicions, worries, anxieties, of pride and panic—of jealousy even. And, like many familiar love stories, it has times of great pleasure and bliss, only to end, because fate or the gods willed it, cataclysmically. In this case, the object of my love was not a woman. It was a small, rectangular piece of land in the south of France. This is the story of my garden."

Tiffany Haddish,The Last Black Unicorn,2017,"School was hard for me, for lots of reasons. One was I couldn’t read until, like, ninth grade. Also I was a foster kid for most of high school, and when my mom went nuts, I had to live with my grandma. That all sucked."

Laura Hillenbrand,Seabiscuit,2001,"In 1938, near the end of a decade of monumental turmoil, the year’s number-one newsmaker was not Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Hitler, or Mussolini.

David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"To some philosophers it appears [a] matter of surprise that all mankind, possessing the same nature and being endowed with the same faculties, should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations, and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by the other."
David Hume,An Enquiry Concerning The Principles of Morals,1751,"Disputes with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are, of all others, the most irksome; except perhaps, those with persons, entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind."

P. D. James,Time to Be in Earnest,1999,"A diary, if intended for publication (and how many written by a novelist are not?), is the most egotistical form of writing.

But for the past nine months, WW recently learned, Gilliam has been lying in a vegetative state at an undisclosed care facility in Clark County, Wash.

He sat back on his knees and held the tile up so the sun through aged yellow curtains seemed to pierce the hole like a laser. He winked at my sister Lecia and me before turning to my gray-haired mother, now bent over her copy of Marcus Aurelius and a bowl of sinus-opening chili, and he quipped, “Now Miss Karr, this looks like a bullet hole.“ Lecia didn’t miss a beat, saying, “Mother, isn’t that where you shot at daddy?“ And Mother squinted up, slid her glasses down her patrician-looking nose and said, very blasé?, “No, that’s where I shot at Larry.“ She wheeled to point at another wall, adding, “Over there’s where I shot at your daddy.“"

Caroline Knapp,Drinking,1996,"It happened this way: I fell in love and then, because the love was ruining everything I cared about, I had to fall out.

Fran Lebowitz,Metropolitan Life,1978,"Contrary to what many of you might imagine, a career in letters is not without its drawbacks—chief among them the unpleasant fact that one is frequently called upon to actually sit down and write."
Fran Lebowitz,Metropolitan Life,1978,As one with a distinct aversion to newspapers I rely heavily for information on the random remarks of others. Therefore my sources are far from impeccable.
Fran Lebowitz,Metropolitan Life,1978,"Democracy is an interesting, even laudable, notion and there is no question but that when compared to Communism, which is too dull, or Fascism, which is too exciting, it emerges as the most palatable form of government."
Fran Lebowitz,Social Studies,1981,People (a group that in my opinion has always attracted an undue amount of attention) have often been likened to snowflakes. This analogy is meant to suggest that each is unique—no two alike. This is quite patently not the case.

Richard Lederer,The Cunning Linguist,2003,"In a junior high-school biology class the teacher asks a student, “Mary please name the part of the human body that expands to six times its normal size and explain under what conditions.” Blushing bright red, Mary simpers, “Teacher that is not a proper question to ask me, and I can’t answer it in front of the class.” The teacher turns to another student and asks, “All right, Johnny, do you have the answer?” “The pupil of the eye, and in dim light.”"
Richard Lederer,Amazing Words,2012,"At seventy-four years of youth, I consider myself to be one of the luckiest men on the face of the earth. Looking back on my life, I can honestly say that I have pretty much closed the distance between who I am and what I do."

I know what comes next as surely as I know the Mississippi rolls down to the sea. The weeping passes, and rage takes hold. The rage burns out, and blame begins. The blame bounces back and forth, and promises are made. The promises wither, and complacency returns. And the complacency stays. It stagnates like a lullaby on autoplay, until another man dies facedown on another street in another city, and the weeping begins again."
George Leonard,Education and Ecstasy,1968,"Teachers are overworked and underpaid. True. It is an exacting and exhausting business, this damming up the flood of human potentialities."
George Leonard,The Ultimate Athlete,1974,"In every fat man, the saying goes, there is a thin man struggling to get out.

Daniel J. Levitin,Successful Aging,2020,"The poet Dylan Thomas wrote that one should not go gently into that good night, that old age should burn and rage at close of day.

A. J. Liebling,The Telephone Booth Indian,1942,"There was once a French-Canadian whose name I cannot at present recall but who had a window in his stomach. It was due to this fortunate circumstance, however unlikely, that a prying fellow of a doctor was able to study the man’s inner workings, and that is how we came to know all about the gastric juices, as I suppose we do."

M. G. Lord,The Accidental Feminist,2012,"You could say it began in 1944 with National Velvet, when Elizabeth Taylor, age twelve, dressed as a boy and stole America’s collective heart.

Mark Manson,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,2016,"Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet.

Groucho Marx,Groucho and Me,1959,"The trouble with writing a book about yourself is that you can’t fool around. If you write about someone else, you can stretch the truth from here to Finland.

W. Somerset Maugham,Strictly Personal,1941,"I have a notion that it is well to tell the reader at the beginning of a narrative what he is in for, and so I shall start by telling you that this is not an account of great events, but of the small things that happened to me during the first fifteen months of the war."

Mary McCarthy,Partisan Review,,Every age has a keyhole to which its eye is pasted.
Mary McCarthy,The New Yorker,,"Teaching for the wisest of the ancients, was only a form of prompting.

Mary McCarthy,Harper’s,1961,"“Pour it on, Colonel,” cried the young man in the Dacron suit excitedly, making his first sortie into the club-car conversation.

Under his darting eyes were two black craters."

Robert McCrum,Every Third Thought,2017,"No one will ever know exactly what happened inside my head on the night of 28 July 1995, but probably it went something like this.

Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I concede that “mutton snapper” is hardly a prepossessing title. The sheep, from which the name derives, is not much of an animal. No civilized person deals with him except in chops and stews. To bleat is not to sing out in a commanding baritone; to be sheepish is scarcely to possess a virtue for which civilization rolls out its more impressive carpets."
Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I have been bird hunting since I was ten years old. I was not much good at it when I was ten, and many years of experience have not made me any better. Sometimes, when asked about the results of my shooting, I am ashamed.

Edmund Morris,Beethoven,2005,"The British playwright Enid Bagnold once asked a feminist what advice she would give to a twenty-three-year-old housewife who, having lost four children, found herself pregnant again by an abusive, alcoholic husband. “I would urge her to terminate the pregnancy,” the feminist replied. “Then,” said Ms. Bagnold, “you would have aborted Beethoven.”"

Lance Morrow,The Wall Street Journal,,"I once knew a magazine journalist who was addicted to metaphors. He was, so to speak, an alcoholic of metaphors.

We are, he and I, on the far side of a dark tarn that lies hidden in the bowl-curved summit of this mountain. The sky is a milky blue above us; no vegetation grows this far up so it is just me and him, the stones and the still black water. He straddles the narrow track with both booted feet and he smiles. I realize several things. That I passed him earlier, farther down the glen. We greeted each other, in the amiable yet brief manner of those on a country walk.

Anna Quindlen,"Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake",2012,"It’s odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn’t know who I was.

Randy Rainbow,Playing with Myself,2022,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…. Fine, I didn’t write that. But it’s how I really wanted the opening chapter of this book to begin.

Ayn Rand,The Los Angeles Times,1990,"The death of Marilyn Monroe shocked people with an impact different from their reaction to the death of any other movie star or public figure.

Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"“God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to change things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” This remarkable statement is attributed to a theologian with whose ideas I disagree in every fundamental respect: Reinhold Niebuhr.

Joy-Ann Reid,Medgar and Myrtle,2024,The thing about love is that it has no chill.
Carl Reiner,I Remember Me,2013,"I Remember Me offers fifty-five chapters of varying lengths, containing remembrances of things past.

Three months ago, I became eligible, and the following is what my mind had stored in my brain."

Mary Roach,Stiff,2003,"The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you."
Mary Roach,Spook,2005,"I don’t recall my mood the morning I was born, but I imagine I felt a bit out of sorts. Nothing I looked at was familiar.

Mary Roach,Bonk,2008,"A man sits in a room, manipulating his kneecaps. It is 1983, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles.

Linda Ronstadt,Simple Dreams,2015,"July 1946 On her way to the hospital the day I was born, my mother wanted to stop and eat a hamburger. She was hungry, and maybe wanted to fortify herself against the brutally hard work of pushing out a baby, a task that lay immediately and ominously before her."
Eleanor Roosevelt,This is My Story,1937,"My mother was one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. The Halls were noted for their beauty and charm in the days when New York City was small enough to have a society spelled with a capital S!

Carl Safina,Becoming Wild,2020,"A flock of scarlet macaws bursts from the deep rainforest like flaming comets, several dozen big, bright birds with streaming tails and hot colors.

If this is the serious business of their lives, they seem to be enjoying themselves and each other."
Deborah Salomon,The Pilot,,"If food were poetry, subs would be limericks, sushi a haiku and salad a sonnet—14 lines of freshness and exquisite flavor. An antidote to winter sludge. A rainbow of colors and often a surprise."
George Sanders,Memoirs of a Professional Cad,1960,"On July 3, 1906, the world was at peace. Nothing of any consequence seemed to be happening in the capital cities of any of its countries. Nothing disturbed the summer lethargy of its population. Everywhere people dozed contentedly, unaware that an event of major importance was taking place in St. Petersburg, Russia. At number 6 Petroffski Ostroff, to Margaret and Henry Sanders, a son of dazzling beauty and infinite charm was being born. It was I."
Robert M. Sapolsky,A Primate’s Memoir,2001,I joined the baboon troop during my twenty-first year. I had never planned to become a savanna baboon when I grew up; instead I had always assumed I would become a mountain gorilla.
William Saroyan,Chance Meetings,1978,"The thing about the people one meets on arrival, upon being born, is that they are the people they are, and not the people any of us, had he indeed had a choice, might be likely to have chosen. These meetings are chance meetings."

Peter Schjeldahl,The Village Voice,,"At a dinner party recently, a nice young political consultant rhapsodized to me about the portent of the millennium, in which he saw the dawn of, yes, a New Age. I wasn’t having it. I remarked that scholars now date the birth of Jesus to about 6 B.C., so the millennium passed already."
Peter Schjeldahl,The New Yorker,,"Lung cancer, rampant. No surprise. I’ve smoked since I was sixteen, behind the high-school football bleachers in Northfield, Minnesota.

Charles M. Schulz,My Life with Charlie Brown,,"And so, 25 years have gone by. At one strip per day, that comes to almost 10,000 comic strips. Actually, this is not so much when you consider the longevity of many other comic features. Employees receive wristwatches if they have put in this much time with a company, but a comic-strip artist just keeps on drawing. (Somehow a comic-strip artist is never regarded as an employee.)"
Murray Schumach,The New York Times,,It was not quite proper to have printed The Carpetbaggers between covers of a book. It should have been inscribed on the walls of a public lavatory.
Alice Sebold,Lucky,1999,"In the tunnel where I was raped, a tunnel that was once an underground entry to an amphitheater, a place where actors burst forth from underneath the seats of a crowd, a girl had been murdered and dismembered.

Peter Selgin,Your First Page,,"I once spoke with a New York City fireman whose job included talking suicidal “jumpers” down from building edges and bridges. He told me something that has stayed with me ever since. He said that in every case, without exception, when the person jumped, the look on his or her face was always the same.

Rod Serling,Los Angeles Times,,"There is a bitter sadness and special irony that attends the passing of Martin Luther King. Quickly and with ease, we offer up a chorus of posthumous praise—the ritual dirge so time-honored and comfortable and undemanding of anything but rhetoric. In death, we offer the acknowledgement of the man and his dream that we denied him in life."
Josh Shaffer,News &amp; Observer,,"To the ears of a musical novice, the tuba ranks lowest in the family of instruments—an oafish cousin with a voice like a bullfrog. It lacks the flash of a saxophone, the brashness of a trumpet or the showiness of a piccolo—the melodic equivalent of a St. Bernard, warbling from the orchestra’s back row."
Josh Shaffer,News &amp; Observer,,"The bagpipe occupies the strangest rung on the musical ladder, shaped like an octopus in plaid pants, sounding to some like a goose with its foot caught in an escalator and played during history’s most lopsided battles—by the losing side."

Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"One evening over dinner in March 2008, I began to joke, as I often had before, about writing an essay called “Men Explain Things to Me.” Every writer has a stable of ideas that never make it to the racetrack, and I’d been trotting this pony out recreationally once in a while."
Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"It was a key match in the World Cup of Ideas. The teams vied furiously for the ball.

Howard Sounes,Charles Bukowski,1998,"Charles Bukowski raised himself up from his chair and got a beer from the refrigerator behind him on stage.

Richard Stengel,You’re Too Kind,2002,"Perfect, gentle reader: I will not begin this book with a tribute to your discernment, because a person of your obvious accomplishments would certainly be immune to such blandishments. You would surely see through such transparent puffery and reject it out of hand. Someone with as much self-assurance and insight as you would not want any soft soap and sycophancy, but rather candor and direct truth. Well, nothing personal, dear reader, but I doubt it."

It had been years since I’d last embraced that most cherished of American freedoms: to slide behind the wheel of a car equipped with a good stereo and comfortable seats, and head out into the country, beholden to no particular route, no timetable; to grow inured to the road, the thrum of the tires, the warbling silence and thuds of a big truck’s slipstream, the whistle of hot summer past the windows. To live off the contents of a cooler on the floorboards and whatever sustenance the road happened to offer."
Earl Swift,Auto Biography,2014,"Behold Tommy Arney: six-one, two-forty, biceps big as most men’s thighs and displayed to maximum effect in the black wifebeater that is his warm-weather fashion essential."
Jonathan Swift,Miscellanies,1711,"We have just religion enough to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another."
Nicholas L. Syrett,An Open Secret,2021,"On March 4, 1960, Robert Allerton became a father. He was 86-years-old at the time and his newly adopted son, John Gregg, was 60. The pair had already been living together and calling themselves father and son for almost four decades."
Nassim Nicholas Taleb,The Black Swan,2007,"Before the discovery of Australia, people in the Old World were convinced that all swans were white, an unassailable belief as it seemed completely confirmed by empirical evidence. The sighting of the first black swan might have been an interesting surprise for a few ornithologists (and others extremely concerned with the coloring of birds), but that is not where the significance of the story lies."
Gay Talese,Esquire,,"Frank Sinatra, holding a glass of bourbon in one hand and a cigarette in the other, stood in a dark corner of the bar between two attractive but fading blondes who sat waiting for him to say something."
Gay Talese,The Kingdom and the Power,1969,"Most journalists are restless voyeurs who see the warts on the world, the imperfections in people and places."
Greg Tamblyn,Atilla the Gate Agent,2007,"I once had an engagement in the town of Normal, Illinois. I was delighted to learn that a place called Normal actually existed, because I happen to live just a few miles from the town of Peculiar, Missouri. I don’t think it’s any accident of the universe that I live a lot closer to Peculiar than Normal."
Barbara Brown Taylor,An Altar in the World,2009,"If I had a dollar for every time I heard someone say, “I am spiritual but not religious,” then I might not be any wiser about what that means—but I would be richer. I hear the phrase on the radio. I read it in interviews. People often say it to my face when they learn that I am a religion professor who spent years as a parish priest."
Barbara Brown Taylor,Holy Envy,2019,"The book in your hands is a small window on a large subject. Set at a private liberal arts college in the foothills of the Appalachians, it is the story of a Christian minister who lost her way in the church and found a new home in the classroom."
Nikola Tesla,Electrical Experimenter,,"The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs."
Lewis Thomas,The Youngest Science: Notes of a Medicine Watcher,1983,"I have always had a bad memory, as far back as I can remember."
Wright Thompson,ESPN.com,,"Pat Conroy’s dad hit him after games. He hit him with fists, and with open palms, hit him until blood ran from Pat’s nose or lip onto his basketball jersey. Don Conroy didn’t hit his son only after games. He hit him for smiling at the wrong time, talking at the wrong time, crying at the wrong time, for trying to defend his battered mother at the wrong time. On occasion, he hit him just for the hell of it."
Henry David Thoreau,Walden,1854,"When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again."

Calvin Trillin,Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin,1990,The reason so many Hollywood movies are made about nerds in high school who triumph in some improbable way over the jocks is this: Nearly everybody who makes movies in Hollywood was himself a nerd in high school.

Calvin Trillin,Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin,1998,It’s common these days for memoirs of childhood to concentrate on some dark secret within the authors ostensibly happy family. It’s not just common; it’s pretty much mandatory.
Calvin Trillin,The New Yorker,,"It’s said that when James Thurber, as a young newspaper reporter, was told by an editor that his story’s first paragraph, what newspaper people might refer to as his lede, suffered from wordiness, he handed in a rewrite whose opening paragraph was, in its entirety, “Dead.” There followed a second paragraph: “That’s what the man was when they found him with a knife in his back at 4pm in front of Riley’s saloon at the corner of 52nd and 12th streets.”"
Harry S Truman,Memoirs,1956,Within the first few months I discovered that being a President is like riding a tiger. A man has to keep on riding or be swallowed.
Mary L. Trump,Too Much and Never Enough,2020,"I’d always liked my name. As a kid at sailing camp in the 1970s, everybody called me Trump. It was a source of pride not because the name was associated with power and real estate (back then my family was unknown outside of Brooklyn and Queens) but because something about the sound of it suited me, a tough six-year-old, afraid of nothing."
Barbara W. Tuchman,The Guns of August,1962,"So gorgeous was the spectacle on the May morning of 1910 when nine kings rode in the funeral of Edward VII of England that the crowd, waiting in hushed and black-clad awe, could not keep back gasps of admiration."
Barbara W. Tuchman,The March of Folly,1984,A phenomenon noticeable throughout history regardless of place or period is the pursuit by governments of policies contrary to their own interests.
Kenneth Tynan,The Observer,1964,"Night- nurses at the bedside of good drama, we critics keep a holy vigil. Black circles rim our eyes as we pray for the survival of our pet patient…."
Kenneth Tynan,The Observer,1964,"Nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth, and the reason is not far to seek. Instead of growing as the play proceeds, the hero shrinks; complex and many-levelled to begin with, he ends up a cornered thug, lacking even a death scene with which to regain lost stature."
Kenneth Tynan,Observer,1964,"“Bloody sparklin’ dialogue,” said a pensive Irishman during the first interval of The Quare Fellow—and sparkle, by any standards, it amazingly did."
Neil deGrasse Tyson,Astrophysics for People in a Hurry,2017,"In the beginning, nearly fourteen billion years ago, all the space and all the matter and all the energy of the known universe was contained in a volume less than one-trillionth the size of the period that ends this sentence."
Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,American Quarterly,2007,"Cotton Mather called them “The hidden ones.“ They never preached or sat in a deacon’s bench. Nor did they vote or attend Harvard. Neither, because they were virtuous women, did they question God or the magistrates. They prayed secretly, read the Bible through at least once a year, and went to hear the minister preach even when it snowed. Hoping for an eternal crown, they never asked to be remembered on earth. And they haven’t been. Well-behaved women seldom make history."
John Updike,Assorted Prose,1965,Pity the poor bore. He stands among us as a creature formidable and familiar yet in essence unknowable. We can read of the ten infallible signs whereby he may be recognized and of the seven tested methods whereby he may be rebuffed.
John Updike,Self-Consciousness,1989,"Had not my twenty-five-year-old daughter undertipped the airline porter in Boston, our luggage might have shown upon the carrousel [sic] in Allentown that April afternoon in 1980, and I would not have spent an evening walking the sidewalks of Shillington, Pennsylvania, searching for the meaning for my existence, as once I had scanned those same sidewalks for lost pennies."
Stevie Van Zandt,Unrequited Infatuations,2021,"My first epiphany came at the age of ten, in 1961, in my room at 263 Wilson Avenue, New Monmouth, Middleton, New Jersey, during my fifty-fifth consecutive time listening to “Pretty Little Angel Eyes” by Curtis Lee. That’s what we did in those days."

Steve Vogel,Reasonable Doubt,,"Like his father and grandfather, Mike Hibbens was a Bloomington, Illinois, policeman. Nothing in the youngest Hibbens’s eleven years as a patrolman (or anything his dad or grandpa had taught him) would prepare him for what he would see the night of November 8, 1983."

Jim Wahlberg,The Big Hustle,2020,"I’d been in fights all my life. I’d been pummeled by the toughest guys you’d ever not want to meet. I’d been beaten up, knocked unconscious, whacked in the head with a crowbar, and thrashed by a prison guard. But far and away the worst gut punch I ever took was when I discovered that my son was on drugs."
Dan Wakefield,The New York Times Magazine,,"Just before Christmas of 1980, I was sitting in the Sevens, a neighborhood bar on Beacon Hill (don’t all these stories of revelation begin in bars?), when a housepainter named Tony remarked out of the blue that he wanted to find a place to go to mass on Christmas Eve.

David Waltner-Toews,On Pandemics,,"Until a few years ago, many scientists had banished words like “threat” and “danger” from our vocabulary. In an attempt to be more rigorously quantitative and less emotional, we began to write about risks. Our response to danger was called “risk management.”"

Alan Watts,The Way of Zen,1957,Zen Buddhism is a way and a view of life which does not belong to any of the formal categories of modern Western thought.

H. G. Wells,Certain Personal Matters,1898,"The art of the essayist is so simple, so entirely free from canons of criticism, and withal so delightful, that one must needs wonder why all men are not essayists. Perhaps people do not know how easy it is. Or perhaps beginners are misled. Rightly taught it may be learnt in a brief ten minutes or so, what art there is in it. And all the rest is as easy as wandering among woodlands on a bright morning in the spring."
Mae West,Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It,1959,"A book about one’s life necessarily demands a tremendous amount of recollection and research, and I have never kept a diary. I once told an interviewer that if I ever kept a diary it would have to be written in invisible ink."

George F. Will,The Washington Post,1997,"A reader demands to know how I contracted the infectious conservatism for which he plans to horsewhip me.

Madeleine Albright,Madam Secretary,2003,I didn’t want it to end.
Madeleine Albright,Prague Winter,,"I was fifty-nine when I began serving as U.S. secretary of state. I thought by then that I knew all there was to know about my past, who “my people” were, and the history of my native land. I was sure enough that I did not feel a need to ask questions.

Roger Angell,Let Me Finish,2006,"Most of the true stories in this book were written in the last three years and came as a surprise to me, the author. I’d not planned a memoir, if that’s what this is, and never owned a diary or made notes about the passage of the days."
Roger Angell,The New Yorker,,"Check me out. The top two knuckles of my left hand look as if I’d been worked over by the K.G.B. No, it’s more as if I’d been a catcher for the Hall of Fame pitcher Candy Cummings, the inventor of the curveball, who retired from the game in 1877. To put this another way, if I pointed that hand at you like a pistol and fired at your nose, the bullet would nail you in the left knee. Arthritis."

Isaac Asimov,Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction,,"I have written three hundred ninety-nine essays for Fantasy & Science Fiction.

Belinda Austin,A House of Sticks,2016,"I never danced with my father but in his shed, I danced with his sawdust swirling around my bone-thin ankles.

Russell Baker,Growing Up,1982,"At the age of eighty my mother had her last bad fall, and after that her mind wandered free through time. Some days she went to weddings and funerals that had taken place half a century earlier. On others she presided over family dinners cooked on Sunday afternoon for children who were now gray with age.

Lionel Barrymore,We Barrymores,1951,"In the watches of the night when old thoughts come to roost, some of them slapping their thighs and roaring, others hiding their faces, two particularly baffling notions often appear to beleaguer me.

W. Kamau Bell,Vanity Fair,,"I am afraid of the cops. Absolutely petrified of the cops. Now understand, I’ve never been arrested or held for questioning.

Greg Bellow,Saul Bellow’s Heart,2013,"On a visit to Chicago when I was eight, I witnessed a terrible argument, in Yiddish, between my father and grandfather.

Joe Biden,Promises to Keep,2007,"Joe Impedimenta, my classmates hung that nickname on me our first semester of high school when we were doing two periods of Latin a day. It was one of the first big words we learned. Impedimenta—the baggage that impedes one’s progress."

Kate Block,Spinster,2015,"Whom to marry, and when it will happen—these two questions define every woman’s existence, regardless of where she was raised or what religion she does or doesn’t practice.

These dual contingencies govern her until they’re answered, even if the answers are nobody and never."
Lawrence Block,The Crime of Our Lives,2015,It was in the eleventh grade that I knew I would be a writer. The conviction grew out of two awarenesses that dawned at about the same time.
Charles M. Blow,Fire Shut Up in My Bones,2014,"Tears flowed out of me from a walled-off place, from another time, from a little boy who couldn’t cry. I had held on to the hurt and shame and doubt for so long, balling it up in the pit of me, that I never thought it would come out, or that it could. I certainly didn’t think it would come out like this. Not in a flash. But there it was. Some of my tears streamed over the arc of my cheeks and off the rim of my jaw. Others rounded the corners of my nose and puddled in the crease of my lips. I didn’t wipe them. I wore them. I looked over at the rusting pistol on the passenger seat. It was a .22 with a long black barrel and a wooden grip."

Jennifer Finney Boylan,Cleavage,2025,"I was born in 1958, on June 22nd, the second day of summer. It was also the birthday of Kris Kristofferson and Meryl Streep, both of whom I later resembled, although not at the same time."
Peg Bracken,A Window Over the Sink,1981,"You may have noticed, as I have, that if you ever find yourself declaring unequivocally that you will never do some one particular thing, chances are good that this is precisely what you will one day find yourself doing."
James Bradley,Flags of Our Fathers,,"In the spring of 1998, six boys called to me from half a century ago on a distant mountain and I went there."
Laurel Braitman,What Looks Like Bravery,2023,"Santa Paula, California, September 1994 It was a warm Saturday afternoon and the Santa Ana winds ruffled the tops of the avocado trees. I was at home with two good friends, all of us sixteen years old, draped like hormonal Dalí clocks over the living room furniture while we watched The Bodyguard on VHS and painted our nails."
Mel Brooks,All About Me!,2021,"The writing of this book serves as a kind of confession. You, the readers will be my confidants. I’m going to tell you all my secrets. Things I’ve never told anybody. Things I don’t want anybody to know! I don’t want you to breathe a word of what you find out in this book. Keep everything under your hat! Wait a minute, wait a minute…that might not work. I’m not in a confessional booth, and a lot of you are probably not priests. This is a book! And this book needs to sell!"
Rita Mae Brown,Rita Will,1997,"My mother was mucking stalls at Hanover Shoe Farm outside of Hanover, Pennsylvania, within a shout of the Mason-Dixon line, when her water broke. Had the hospital not been nearby, I would have been born in a manger."
Susan Brownmiller,In Our Time,1999,"I was not there at the beginning. Few people were. And although I can speak with confidence of a beginning, of certain documented rebellions sparked by a handful of visionaries with stubborn courage, there were antecedents to those rebellions, and antecedents to the antecedents."
Frank Bruni,The Beauty of Dusk,2022,"They say that death comes like a thief in the night. Lesser vandals have the same MO. The affliction that stole my vision, or at least a big chuck of it, did so as I slept. I went to bed seeing the world one way. I woke up seeing it another."
Art Buchwald,Too Soon to Say Goodbye,2006,"What started out the worst of times ended up the best of times. The big news of 2006 is that I’m still alive. After being in the hospice waiting to die, I said, “To hell with it, I’m going to write a book.”"
Christopher Buckley,Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir,2009,"I’m not sure how this book will turn out. I mostly write novels, and I’ve found, having written half a dozen, that if you’re lucky, the ending turns out a surprise and you wind up with something you hadn’t anticipated in the outline. I suppose it’s a process of outsmarting yourself (not especially hard in my case)."
"William F. Buckley, Jr.","Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith",1997,It was during the summer of 1938 that we were given the dreadful news.
Frederick Buechner,Telling Secrets,1991,"One November morning in 1936 when I was ten years old, my father got up early, put on a pair of gray slacks and a maroon sweater, opened the door to look in briefly on my younger brother and me, who were playing a game in our room, and then went down into the garage where he turned on the engine of the family Chevy and sat down on the running board to wait for the exhaust to kill him."
Jimmy Buffett,A Pirate Looks at Fifty,1998,"When I was growing up in Alabama, the beginning of the new school year was a bad time. It meant the end of summer, which is my season.

Michael Caine,What’s It All About?,1992,"The first time I was in the United States, when I had just made Alfie, I was sitting on my own in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel and heard the sound of a helicopter landing in the gardens opposite. This, the porter told me, was strictly illegal. He and I stood at the door to see who was so flagrantly flouting the law—presumably the President, of the United States or at least of the Beverly Hills Hotel. Across Sunset Boulevard, out of a swirling sun-flecked cloud of dust, six foot four and in full cowboy get-up, strode the unmistakable figure of John Wayne."
Michael Caine,The Elephant to Hollywood,2010,"Well, it’s a long way from London’s Elephant and Castle to Hollywood. And the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line—as my story is going to prove. But then I’ve never been known for doing things the easy way. I wouldn’t have minded easy, but things just never worked out quite like that. In fact—although I couldn’t have known it at the time—they worked out a whole lot better."
Ilia Calderón,My Time To Speak,2020,"All my attention was focused on his face. It’s what I remember most clearly more than two years after our encounter. That face that had raged red as soon as he saw me, and continued angry, indignant. His nostrils flared with his agitated breathing, which he unsuccessfully attempted to control. He responded quickly, hot, like a lit fuse, not letting anyone else talk. And then, suddenly, I heard it from his own lips, “We’re going to burn you out.”"
Frank Capra,The Name Above the Title,1971,"I hated being poor. Hated being a peasant. Hated being a scrounging newskid trapped in the sleazy Sicilian ghetto of Los Angeles. My family couldn’t read or write. I wanted out. A quick out. I looked for a device, a handle, a pole to catapult myself across the tracks from my scurvy habitat of nobodies to the affluent world of somebodies."
Mariah Carey,The Meaning of Mariah Carey,,"My intention was to keep her safe, but perhaps I have only succeeded in keeping her prisoner."
Rubin Carter,The Sixteenth Round,1974,"RUBIN, my Christian name, comes from the Book of Genesis, Chapter 29, verse 32 of the Holy Scriptures. Other than both of us being black, that’s about the only thing the Bible and I ever had in common."
Bennett Cerf,At Random,1977,I am a rather unusual specimen in that not only I but all four of my grandparents and both of my parents were born on the island of Manhattan.

G. K. Chesterton,The Autobiography of G. K. Chesterton,1936,"Bowing down in blind credulity, as is my custom, before mere authority and the tradition of the elders, superstitiously swallowing a story I could not test at the time by experiment or private judgment, I am firmly of the opinion that I was born on the 29th of May, 1874, on Campden Hill, Kensington."
Shirley Chisholm,Unbought and Unbossed,1970,"There are 435 members of the House of Representatives and 417 are white males. Ten of the others are women and nine are black. I belong to both of these minorities, which makes it add up right."

Connie Chung,Connie,2024,I didn’t start out wanting to be a guy.
Hillary Rodham Clinton,What Happened,2017,"Deep breath. Feel the air in my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out. Scream later."
Jacqueline Cochran,The Stars at Noon,1954,"I am a refugee from Sawdust Road, which is located in the South close by Tobacco Road of theater and movie fame."
Judy Collins,Sweet Judy Blue Eyes,2011,"It’s a Sunday night, and I am traveling from Hartford to New York City, heading in from a show. Rain pours down, and the driver of my sedan is battling the storm like a captain of a schooner in white waves. Thoughts of my life flow like the water around us: years of life, love and anger, rage and hope; the songs I have sung; the men and women I have loved."
Blayney Colmore,I Reserve the Right to be Terrified,2022,"The road was steep. But it leveled off at the bottom, so you got a nice glide before the next hill. We’d ridden that road a lot, so we let the bikes run. Last I looked at the speedometer it read between 30 and 35 miles per hour. Exhilarating. Conrad and his daughter Karen were much more experienced and stronger bikers than I was. I followed them down the hill. They both skillfully avoided the board in the road. I never saw it. He told me later that he saw me launch from my bike like a rocket. “You must have gone 20 feet in the air before you landed.” When Karen saw me lying motionless on the road, she said, “Oh God, Dad, I think he’s dead.”"

Kelly Corrigan,The Middle Place,2008,"The thing you need to know about me is that I am George Corrigan’s daughter, his only daughter. You may have met him, in which case just skip this part. If you haven’t, I’ll do what I can to describe him, but really, you should try to meet him."
Kelly Corrigan,Glitter and Glue,2013,"When I was growing up, my mom was guided by the strong belief that to befriend me was to deny me the one thing a kid really needed to survive childhood: a mother."
Maureen Corrigan,"Leave Me Alone, I’m Reading",2005,It’s not that I don’t like people. It’s just that when I’m in the company of others—even my nearest and dearest—there always comes a moment when I’d rather be reading a book.
Norman Cousins,Anatomy of an Illness,1979,"This book is about a serious illness that occurred in 1964. I was reluctant to write about it for many years because I was fearful of creating false hopes in others who were similarly afflicted. Moreover, I knew that a single case has small standing in the annals of medical research, having little more than “anecdotal” or “testimonial” value."
Noël Coward,Present Indicative,1937,"I was photographed naked on a cushion very early in life, an insane, toothless smile slitting my face and pleats of fat overlapping me like an ill-fitting overcoat."

Billy Crystal,Still Foolin’ ‘Em,2013,"March 14, 2013, my sixty-fifth birthday. I got up that morning, padded over to the bathroom, threw some water on my face, looked in the mirror, and my uncle Al was staring back at me. My scream brought Janice, my wife of forty-two years, running in. I kept yelling, “HOLY SHIT! What the fuck happened to me?” Somehow, overnight, it seemed I had turned from a hip, cool baby boomer into a Diane Arbus photograph."
Salvador Dalí,The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí,1942,At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. At seven I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily ever since.
Salvador Dalí,Diary of a Genius,1966,"Ever since the French Revolution there has been growing up a vicious, cretinizing tendency to consider a genius as a human being more or less the same in every respect (apart from his work) as ordinary mortals. This is false."
"Richard Henry Dana, Jr.",Two Years Before the Mast,1840,"The fourteenth of August was the day fixed upon for the sailing of the brig Pilgrim, on her voyage from Boston, round Cape Horn, to the Western coast of North America."
Patti Davis,The New York Times,2023,"During the early stages of my father’s Alzheimer’s, when he still had lucid moments, I apologized to him for writing an autobiography many years earlier in which I flung open the gates of our troubled family life. He was already talking less at that point, but his eyes told me he understood."

Simone de Beauvoir,The Autobiography of Simone de Beauvoir,1963,"Young women have an acute sense of what should and should not be done when one is no longer young. “I don’t understand,” they say, “how a woman over forty can bleach her hair; how she can make an exhibition of herself in a bikini; how she can flirt with men. The day I’m her age…” [ellipsis in original]"

Belle de Jour,The Further Adventures of a London Call Girl,2006,"“What I want, what I really want…this probably sounds silly…is to please you.“ The client was fiftyish, dressed office-casual. Oh great, I thought, another half-hour of earnest licking from a man whose wife no doubt thinks her body stops at the waist. “That’s a gorgeous idea,” I purred."
Belle de Jour,Belle de Jour’s Guide to Men,2009,"You might be wondering what, exactly, a prostitute might have to say about men and relationships… [ellipsis in original] Let’s put it this way: I have met men. Loads of men. Men of every conceivable shape, size, and type. In my work as a call girl, I have seen them at their most cocksure and at their most vulnerable. And if this experience has taught me anything at all, it is that this odd and inscrutable species we call Man is often libelously misrepresented in the female press."
John Denver,Take Me Home,,"They met in Tulsa. Dad was a ploughboy from western Oklahoma; Mom was a hometown girl. He was in the Army Air Corps, studying the mechanics of flight at the Spartan School of Aeronautics, and she had been first-prize winner in a jitterbug contest the year before. It was 1942: She was just turning eighteen, a high-school senior; and he was twenty-one."
William Deresiewicz,A Jane Austen Education,2011,"I was twenty-six, and about as dumb, in all human things, as any twenty-six-year-old has a right to be, when I met the woman who would change my life. That she’d been dead for a couple of hundred years made not the slightest difference whatsoever."
Bernadette Devlin,The Price of My Soul,1969,"The Price of My Soul is not a work of art, an autobiography, or a political manifesto. Readers who expect one or other of these things will no doubt class it as a failure. Let them. I’m not basically concerned with its success, financial or literary."

Joan Didion,The White Album,1979,We tell ourselves stories in order to live.
Joan Didion,The Year of Magical Thinking,2006,Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The question of self-pity. Those were the first words I wrote after it happened.
Annie Dillard,The Writing Life,1989,"When you write, you lay out a line of words. The line of words is a miner’s pick, a woodcarver’s gouge, a surgeon’s probe. You wield it, and it digs a path you follow."
Michael Dirda,An Open Book,2003,Daydreaming is my only hobby.
Caitlin Doughty,Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,2014,A girl always remembers the first corpse she shaves.

Peter F. Drucker,Adventures of a Bystander,1978,Bystanders have no history of their own. They are on the stage but are not part of the action. They are not even audience.

Daphne du Maurier,Myself When Young,1977,All autobiography is self-indulgent.
"Meghan, Duchess of Sessex (formerly Meghan Markle)",The New York Times,,"It was a July morning that began as ordinarily as any other day: Make breakfast. Feed the dogs. Take vitamins. Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib. After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second."

Albert Einstein,Saturday Review of Literature,1949,"Here I sit in order to write, at the age of sixty-seven, something like my own obituary. I am doing this because I believe it is a good thing to show those who are striving alongside us how one’s own striving and searching appear to one in retrospect."
Linda Ellerbee,“And So It Goes”,1986,"I wouldn’t mind writing one of those books about the good old days—how I went out into the land and committed journalism, covering the important stories, every one of them, everywhere, better than anyone—but the thing about lying is that unless you’re a political candidate or a network vice president, you’ve got to set yourself some limits and hold fast."
Linda Ellerbee,Move On: Adventures in the Real World,1991,"I packed up his comic books, sold off the bunk beds, gave away the last Star Wars sheet and threw out the beanbag chair that had bled to death in 1975. I tore down the six MASH posters super-glued to the wall between his room and mine."
Linda Ellerbee,Take Big Bites,2005,"I’m not crazy about Florence except for the pig museum. If precisely speaking, it’s not a museum, that’s only because some fool in the Italian government doesn’t recognize a national treasure when he sees one."

Edna Ferber,A Peculiar Treasure,1938,"When I was a small girl living in Appleton, Wisconsin, I often was sent with a quart tin pail to the creamery which was three blocks away on the wrong side of the railroad tracks. The Ferber family, I hastily and grandly add, lived on the right side of the tracks. Any native Middle West American will get the social significance (and the revolting snobbery) of that statement."
Edna Ferber,A Kind of Magic,1963,"To be alive is a fine thing. It is the finest thing in the world, though hazardous."
Harvey Fierstein,I Was Better Last Night,2022,"Philomena Marano got the role of the Evil Witch and I was cast as the King. The King? Who wants to be the King?

Michael J. Fox,Lucky Man,2003,"Gainesville, Florida—November 1990 I woke up to find the message in my left hand. It had me trembling. It wasn’t a fax, telegram, memo, or the usual sort of missive bringing disturbing news. In fact, my hand held nothing at all. The trembling was the message."

Viktor E. Frankl,Man’s Search for Meaning,1946,"This book does not claim to be an account of facts and events but of personal experiences, experiences which millions of prisoners have suffered time and time again. It is the inside story of a concentration camp, told by one of its survivors."

Mohandas K Gandhi,An Autobiography,1927,"Four or five years ago, at the insistence of some of my nearest co-workers, I agreed to write my autobiography.

Then followed a series of events which culminated in my imprisonment…."
David Gerrold,Worlds of Wonder,2018,"The very best writing instructor I ever had was an incompetent. A terminal alcoholic who could barely find the classroom each day, he was a bleary-eyed, red-nosed, overstuffed, walking elbow-wrinkle of a human being. Whatever writing ability he’d ever had, he’d long since drowned it, and the corpse was a layer of dried sediment at the bottom of a bottle. He didn’t like me either."
Elizabeth Gilbert,Esquire,,"I was not the prettiest bartender at the Coyote Ugly Saloon. In my opinion, that would have been Caroline. I was partial to Caroline, though, because she had been so nice to me when I began working here. She was very pretty and also very funny. When I asked Caroline how she’d gotten her first bartender job, she cupped her breasts and said simply, “These.”"

William Goldman,Which Lie Did I Tell,2000,"I don’t think I was aware of it, but when I started work on Adventures in the Skin Trade, in 1980, I had become a leper in Hollywood. Let me explain what that means: The phone stopped ringing."
Richard Goodman,French Dirt,,"This is a love story. Like most love stories. it has its share of joy and passion, of loss and pain. Like most love stories, it also has its moments of melodrama, of emotions run amok, of suspicions, worries, anxieties, of pride and panic—of jealousy even. And, like many familiar love stories, it has times of great pleasure and bliss, only to end, because fate or the gods willed it, cataclysmically. In this case, the object of my love was not a woman. It was a small, rectangular piece of land in the south of France. This is the story of my garden."

Wayne Gretzky,Gretzky,,"I have to admit, my childhood was a little different."
Dave Grohl,The Storyteller,2021,"Sometimes I forget that I’ve aged.

Joumana Haddad,I Killed Scheherazade,2010,"Dear Westerner, Allow me to warn you right from the start: I am not known for making lives any easier. So if you are looking here for truths you think you already know, and for proofs you believe you already have; if you are longing to be comforted in your Orientalist views, or reassured in your anti-Arab prejudices; if you are expecting to hear the lullaby of the clash of civilizations, you better not go any further."
Tiffany Haddish,The Last Black Unicorn,2017,"School was hard for me, for lots of reasons. One was I couldn’t read until, like, ninth grade. Also I was a foster kid for most of high school, and when my mom went nuts, I had to live with my grandma. That all sucked."
Matt Haig,Reasons to Stay Alive,2015,I can remember the day the old me died. It started with a thought. Something was going wrong. That was the start. Before I realized what it was.
Pete Hamill,The Drinking Life,1995,"This is a book about my time in the drinking life. It tells the story of the way one human being became aware of alcohol, embraced it, struggled with it, was hurt by it, and finally left it behind. The tale has no hero."

Anita Hill,"Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home",2011,"In August 1973, three weeks past my seventeenth birthday, I packed my clothes in three hand-me-down Samsonite suitcases and left the only place I had ever called home.

P. D. James,Time to Be in Earnest,1999,"A diary, if intended for publication (and how many written by a novelist are not?), is the most egotistical form of writing. The assumption is inevitably that what the writer, thinks, does, sees, eats and drinks on a daily basis is as interesting to others as it is to himself or herself."
Margo Jefferson,Negroland,2015,"I was taught to avoid showing off. I was taught to distinguish myself through presentation, not declaration, to excel through deeds and manners, not showing off. But isn’t all memoir a form of showing off?"

Mary Karr,The Liar’s Club,1995,"Not long before my mother died, the tile guy redoing her kitchen pried from the wall a tile with an unlikely round hole in it. He sat back on his knees and held the tile up so the sun through aged yellow curtains seemed to pierce the hole like a laser. He winked at my sister Lecia and me before turning to my gray-haired mother, now bent over her copy of Marcus Aurelius and a bowl of sinus-opening chili, and he quipped, “Now Miss Karr, this looks like a bullet hole.“ Lecia didn’t miss a beat, saying, “Mother, isn’t that where you shot at daddy?“ And Mother squinted up, slid her glasses down her patrician-looking nose and said, very blasé?, “No, that’s where I shot at Larry.“ She wheeled to point at another wall, adding, “Over there’s where I shot at your daddy.“"
Mary Karr,Cherry,2000,"No road offers more mystery than that first one you mount from the town you were born to, the first time you mount it of your own volition, on a trip funded by your own coffee tin of wrinkled up dollars—bills you’ve saved and scrounged for, worked the all-night switchboard for, missed the Rolling Stones for, sold fragrant pot with smashed flowers going brown inside twist-tie plastic baggies for. In fact, to disembark from your origins, you’ve done everything you can think to scrounge money save selling your spanking young pussy."
Mary Karr,Lit,2009,"Any way I tell this story is a lie, so I ask you to disconnect the device in your head that repeats at intervals how ancient and addled I am."
Susanna Kaysen,"Girl, Interrupted",1993,"People ask, How did you get in there? What they really want to know is if they are likely to end up there as well. I can’t answer the real question. All I can tell them is, It’s easy."
Buster Keaton,My Wonderful World of Slapstick,,"Down through the years my face has been called a sour puss, a dead pan, a frozen face, The Great Stone Face, and, believe it or not, ""a tragic mask."" On the other hand that kindly critic, the late James Agee, described my face as ranking ""almost with Lincoln's as an early American archetype, it was haunting, handsome, almost beautiful."""
Helen Keller,The Story of My Life,1902,"It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. I have, as it were, a superstitious hesitation in lifting the veil that clings about my childhood like a golden mist."
Piper Kerman,Orange is the New Black,2010,"International baggage claim in the Brussels airport was large and airy, with multiple carousels circling endlessly. I scurried from one to another, desperately trying to find my black suitcase. Because it was stuffed with drug money, I was more concerned than one might normally be about lost luggage."
Alicia Keyes,More Myself,,"I am seven. My mom and I are side by side in the back seat of a yellow taxi, making our way up Eleventh Avenue in Manhattan on a dead-cold day in December. We hardly ever take cabs. They’re a luxury for a single parent and part-time actress. But on this afternoon, maybe because Mom has just finished an audition near my school, PS 116 on East Thirty-third Street, or maybe because it’s so freezing we can see our breath, she picks me up."
Stephen King,On Writing,2000,"My earliest memory is of imagining I was someone else—imagining that I was, in fact, the Ringling Brothers Circus Strongboy. This was at my Aunt Ethelyn and Uncle Oren’s house in Durham, Maine. My aunt remembers this quite clearly, and say I was two and a half or maybe three years old."
"Martin Luther King, Jr.",Strength to Love,1963,"A French philosopher said, “No man is strong unless he bears within his character antitheses strongly marked.” The strong man holds in a living blend strongly marked opposites."
Laura Kipnis,Men,2014,"Men have fascinated me, maybe too much. They’ve troubled me. They’re large and take up a lot of space—space in the imagination, I mean. They force you to think about them."
Caroline Knapp,Drinking,1996,"It happened this way: I fell in love and then, because the love was ruining everything I cared about, I had to fall out. This didn’t happen easily, or simply, but if I had to pinpoint it, I’d say the relationship started to fall apart the night I nearly killed my oldest friend’s two daughters."
Natalie Kusz,Road Song,1990,"Our first months in Alaska, that one long summertime before I was hurt, were hard—in the way, I think, that all immigrants’ lives must be hard—but they were also very grand, full of wood fires and campgrounds, full of people and the stories they told at night when we ate all together, full of clean dust that we washed from our bodies with water carried home from cold springs."
Chaney Kwak,The Passenger,2021,"As the cruise ship almost tips over, the horizon that once bisected my lovely balcony door rises like a theater curtain and disappears. Now the sea is the stage. I tumble off my bed onto the floor and roll like a stuntman."

Richard Lederer,Amazing Words,2012,"At seventy-four years of youth, I consider myself to be one of the luckiest men on the face of the earth. Looking back on my life, I can honestly say that I have pretty much closed the distance between who I am and what I do."
Andrew Leland,The Country of the Blind,2023,I’m going blind as I write this.
Don Lemon,This is the Fire,2021,"May 25, 2020 Dear Trushaad, Today I heard a dying man call out to his mama, and I wept for the world that will soon belong to you. I know what comes next as surely as I know the Mississippi rolls down to the sea. The weeping passes, and rage takes hold. The rage burns out, and blame begins. The blame bounces back and forth, and promises are made. The promises wither, and complacency returns. And the complacency stays. It stagnates like a lullaby on autoplay, until another man dies facedown on another street in another city, and the weeping begins again."

Phillip Lopate,To Show and To Tell,2013,"I should explain straight-out that I consider myself to be as much a teacher as writer. It’s not simply that a good deal of my annual income derives from teaching; it’s also that I find it a fascinating challenge, one that nourishes my psyche—and my own writing."
Nelson Mandela,Long Walk to Freedom,1994,"Apart from life, a strong constitution, and an abiding connection to the Thembu royal house, the only thing my father bestowed upon me at birth was a name, Rolihlahla. In Xhosa, Rolihlahla literally means “pulling the branch of a tree,” but its colloquial meaning more accurately would be “trouble maker.”"
Stephen Marlowe,The Memoirs of Christopher Columbus,1987,"If Holy Week and Passover hadn’t fallen at the same time the year I was born, none of this would have happened."
Groucho Marx,Groucho and Me,1959,"The trouble with writing a book about yourself is that you can’t fool around. If you write about someone else, you can stretch the truth from here to Finland. If you write about yourself, the slightest deviation makes you realize instantly that there may be honor among thieves, but you are just a dirty liar."
W. Somerset Maugham,The Summing Up,1938,This is not an autobiography nor is it a book of recollections. In one way and another I have used in my writings whatever has happened to me in the course of my life.
W. Somerset Maugham,Strictly Personal,1941,"I have a notion that it is well to tell the reader at the beginning of a narrative what he is in for, and so I shall start by telling you that this is not an account of great events, but of the small things that happened to me during the first fifteen months of the war."

Robert McCrum,Every Third Thought,2017,"No one will ever know exactly what happened inside my head on the night of 28 July 1995, but probably it went something like this. First, for reasons that remain mysterious, a surreptitious clot began to form in one of my cerebral arteries, cutting off the blood supply to the one organ in the body that, after the heart, is most greedy for blood."
Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"Like many who buy a motorcycle, there had been for me the problem of getting over the rather harrowing insurance statistics as to just what it is that is likely to happen to you."
Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I have been bird hunting since I was ten years old.

Dave Meggyesy,Out of Their League,1970,"You may not know it, but you’ve probably seen me on television a few times during the last seven years or so—that is if you’re one of the 25 million Americans who zeroes in on pro football for several hours every fall weekend. I wasn’t a glamour player, and the St. Louis Cardinals, where I played linebacker, wasn’t a glamour team; but I was out there, along with a thousand or so other guys, most of them as anonymous as me. But you won’t see me out there again."

Caitlin Myer,Wiving,2020,"I am fifty years old and have just moved to a seaside town in Portugal. I’m reading in a quiet bar when a man asks why a beautiful woman like me is alone.

David Niven,The Moon’s a Balloon,1971,"Nessie, when I first saw her, was seventeen years old, honey-blond, pretty rather than beautiful, the owner of a voluptuous but somehow innocent body and a pair of legs that went on for ever.

(If you would like to skip on and meet Nessie more fully, she reappears on page 41.)"
David Niven,Bring on the Empty Horses,1975,"When Gertrude Stein returned to New York after a short sojourn to Hollywood somebody asked her…“What is it like—out there?” To which, with little delay and the minimum of careful thought the sage replied…“There is no ‘there’—there.”"

Maggie O’Farrell,"I Am, I Am, I Am",2017,"On the path ahead, stepping out from behind a boulder, a man appears. We are, he and I, on the far side of a dark tarn that lies hidden in the bowl-curved summit of this mountain. The sky is a milky blue above us; no vegetation grows this far up so it is just me and him, the stones and the still black water. He straddles the narrow track with both booted feet and he smiles. I realize several things. That I passed him earlier, farther down the glen. We greeted each other, in the amiable yet brief manner of those on a country walk. That, on this remote stretch of path, there is no one near enough to hear me call. That he has been waiting for me: he has planned this whole thing, carefully, meticulously, and I have walked into his trap. I see all this, in an instant"

Meghan O’Rourke,The Invisible Kingdom,2022,"The stories we tell about illness usually have startling beginnings—the fall at the supermarket, the lump discovered in the abdomen during a routine exam, the doctor’s call.

Charles Osgood,Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack,2004,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Charles Dickens didn’t write those words about the year that I was nine in Baltimore, but they happen to fit.

Dolly Parton,Dolly,1994,"Once upon a time and far, far away, back in the hollers at the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee there lived a little girl with yellow hair, blue-green eyes, fair skin, and freckles. She loved to read almost as much as she loved to dream."

Billy Porter,Unprotected,2021,"This is not a coming-out-story. It’s not a down-low story either. I never could have passed for straight, even if I’d wanted to, and so I never had the dubious luxury of living a lie."
Colin Powell,My American Journey,,"I usually trust my instincts. This time I did not, which almost proved fatal."
Anna Quindlen,"Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake",2012,"It’s odd when I think of the arc of my life, from child to young woman to aging adult. First I was who I was. Then I didn’t know who I was.

Randy Rainbow,Playing with Myself,2022,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…. Fine, I didn’t write that. But it’s how I really wanted the opening chapter of this book to begin.

Carl Reiner,I Remember Me,2013,"I Remember Me offers fifty-five chapters of varying lengths, containing remembrances of things past.

Three months ago, I became eligible, and the following is what my mind had stored in my brain."
James Reston,Deadline,1991,"I started to write this book as a political memoir of my fifty years as a reporter, columnist, Washington correspondent, and executive editor of The New York Times, but it got away from me and turned into a personal memoir of love and hope."

Ann Richards,Straight from the Heart,,"My Daddy used to say, “She looks like she was rode hard and put up wet,” and that is about the way I feel on finishing this book. Telling the story of your life is not an easy task."

"James Haywood Rolling, Jr.",Growing Up Ugly,2020,I used to think I was born ugly. I wasn’t sure why in the beginning.

Linda Ronstadt,Simple Dreams,2015,"July 1946 On her way to the hospital the day I was born, my mother wanted to stop and eat a hamburger. She was hungry, and maybe wanted to fortify herself against the brutally hard work of pushing out a baby, a task that lay immediately and ominously before her."
Eleanor Roosevelt,This is My Story,1937,"My mother was one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. The Halls were noted for their beauty and charm in the days when New York City was small enough to have a society spelled with a capital S! She had been largely brought up by her father, who died when she was seventeen. It must have been a curious household, for my Grandfather Hall never engaged in business. He lived on what his father and mother gave him."
Rosemarie Rossetti,Take Back Your Life!,2003,"It was Saturday, June 13, 1998, a glorious day for many reasons. My husband Mark and I were celebrating our third wedding anniversary, and the weather was beautiful—warm and windless. We decided to go for a bicycle ride on a trail in Granville, Ohio, and arrived about 5:00 p.m. We were happily riding for about ten minutes when Mark heard a loud noise that sounded like a gunshot.

Bertrand Russell,My Philosophical Development,1959,My philosophical development may be divided into various stages according to the problems with which I have been concerned and the men whose work has influenced me.

George Sanders,Memoirs of a Professional Cad,1960,"On July 3, 1906, the world was at peace. Nothing of any consequence seemed to be happening in the capital cities of any of its countries. Nothing disturbed the summer lethargy of its population. Everywhere people dozed contentedly, unaware that an event of major importance was taking place in St. Petersburg, Russia. At number 6 Petroffski Ostroff, to Margaret and Henry Sanders, a son of dazzling beauty and infinite charm was being born. It was I."

Charles M. Schulz,My Life with Charlie Brown,,"And so, 25 years have gone by. At one strip per day, that comes to almost 10,000 comic strips. Actually, this is not so much when you consider the longevity of many other comic features. Employees receive wristwatches if they have put in this much time with a company, but a comic-strip artist just keeps on drawing. (Somehow a comic-strip artist is never regarded as an employee.)"
Alice Sebold,Lucky,1999,"In the tunnel where I was raped, a tunnel that was once an underground entry to an amphitheater, a place where actors burst forth from underneath the seats of a crowd, a girl had been murdered and dismembered.

Anna Sewell,Black Beauty,1877,"The first place that I can well remember was a pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook, overhung by a steep bank."

John Steinbeck,Travels with Charley,1962,"When I was very young and the urge to be someplace else was on me, I was assured by mature people that maturity would cure this itch. When years described me as mature, the remedy prescribed was middle age. In middle age I was assured that greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked."
David Steinberg,Inside Comedy,2021,"Insecurity combined with arrogance is good DNA for a comedian. So is anger, aggression, and sadness."
Sharon Stone,The Beauty of Living Twice,2021,"I opened my eyes, and there he was standing over me, just inches from my face. A stranger looking at me with so much kindness that I was sure I was going to die. He was stroking my head, my hair; God, he was handsome. I wished he were someone who loved me instead of someone whose next words were “You’re bleeding into your brain.”"

Willie Sutton,Where the Money Was,,"What am I doing, I ask myself, standing on a corner at six o’clock in the morning freezing my ass off? Hell, I am almost forty-nine years old. I have been a fugitive for three full years now. I am number one on the FBI Wanted List. If I am caught I will go back to prison for life. They don’t even have to catch me for another bank robbery, all they have to do is get their hands on me."

Barbara Brown Taylor,Holy Envy,2019,"The book in your hands is a small window on a large subject. Set at a private liberal arts college in the foothills of the Appalachians, it is the story of a Christian minister who lost her way in the church and found a new home in the classroom."
Nikola Tesla,Electrical Experimenter,,"The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs."

Henry David Thoreau,Walden,1854,"When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again."

Calvin Trillin,Quite Enough of Calvin Trillin,1998,It’s common these days for memoirs of childhood to concentrate on some dark secret within the authors ostensibly happy family. It’s not just common; it’s pretty much mandatory.
Harry S Truman,Memoirs,1956,Within the first few months I discovered that being a President is like riding a tiger. A man has to keep on riding or be swallowed.
Mary L. Trump,Too Much and Never Enough,2020,"I’d always liked my name. As a kid at sailing camp in the 1970s, everybody called me Trump. It was a source of pride not because the name was associated with power and real estate (back then my family was unknown outside of Brooklyn and Queens) but because something about the sound of it suited me, a tough six-year-old, afraid of nothing."
Mark Twain,Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc,1896,This is the year 1492. I am eighty-two years of age. The things I am going to tell you about are things which I saw myself as a child and as a youth.
John Updike,Self-Consciousness,1989,"Had not my twenty-five-year-old daughter undertipped the airline porter in Boston, our luggage might have shown upon the carrousel [sic] in Allentown that April afternoon in 1980, and I would not have spent an evening walking the sidewalks of Shillington, Pennsylvania, searching for the meaning for my existence, as once I had scanned those same sidewalks for lost pennies."
Stevie Van Zandt,Unrequited Infatuations,2021,"My first epiphany came at the age of ten, in 1961, in my room at 263 Wilson Avenue, New Monmouth, Middleton, New Jersey, during my fifty-fifth consecutive time listening to “Pretty Little Angel Eyes” by Curtis Lee. That’s what we did in those days."

Jim Wahlberg,The Big Hustle,2020,"I’d been in fights all my life. I’d been pummeled by the toughest guys you’d ever not want to meet. I’d been beaten up, knocked unconscious, whacked in the head with a crowbar, and thrashed by a prison guard. But far and away the worst gut punch I ever took was when I discovered that my son was on drugs."
Dan Wakefield,The New York Times Magazine,,"Just before Christmas of 1980, I was sitting in the Sevens, a neighborhood bar on Beacon Hill (don’t all these stories of revelation begin in bars?), when a housepainter named Tony remarked out of the blue that he wanted to find a place to go to mass on Christmas Eve.

Mae West,Goodness Had Nothing to Do With It,1959,"A book about one’s life necessarily demands a tremendous amount of recollection and research, and I have never kept a diary. I once told an interviewer that if I ever kept a diary it would have to be written in invisible ink."

Joan Acocella,The New Yorker,,"Susan Sontag did two big things last year. She finished a novel, In America, and underwent treatment for cancer."
Joan Acocella,The New Yorker,,"Clang! Clang! Down the corridors of religious history we hear this sound: Martin Luther, an energetic thirty-three-year-old Augustinian friar, hammering his Ninety-five Theses to the doors of the Castle Church of Wittenburg, in Saxony, and thus, eventually, splitting the thousand-year-old Catholic Church into two churches—one loyal to the Pope in Rome, the other protesting against the Pope’s rule and soon, in fact, calling itself Protestant."
Lisa Allardice,Telegraph,,"Beautiful, gifted and irresistible to both men and women, Rudolf Nureyev was ballet’s first pin-up—the Beckham of the barre. He danced, lived and made love with an appetite and abandon that was both thrilling and terrifying."
Bob Allen,Esquire,,"It all began rather innocently one languid afternoon in 1969. Merle Haggard and the Bakersfield bubbahs in his road band, the Strangers, were riding in their tour bus through the drab, dusty east Oklahoma flatlands when suddenly a road sign for Muskogee came into view.

Paul Auster,Burning Boy,2021,"Born on the Day of the Dead and dead five months before his twenty-ninth birthday, Stephen Crane lived five months and five days into the twentieth century, undone by tuberculosis before he had a chance to drive an automobile or see an airplane, to watch a film projected on a large screen or listen to a radio, a figure from the horse-and-buggy world who missed out on the future that was awaiting his peers, not just the construction of those miraculous machines and inventions but the horrors of the age as well, including the destruction of tens of millions of lives in two wars."
Bruce Barton,The Man Nobody Knows,1952,"It was very late in the afternoon. If you would like to learn the measure of a man that is the time of day to watch him. We are all half an inch taller in the morning than at night; it is fairly easy to take a large view of things when the mind is rested and the nerves are calm. But the day is a steady drain of small annoyances, and the difference in the size of men becomes hourly more apparent. The little man loses his temper; the big man takes a firmer hold. It was very late in the afternoon in Galilee."

Cyril Bibby,T. H. Huxley,1959,"On the 4th of May 1825, when Thomas Henry Huxley was born in the sleepy old village of Ealing, English society still had its roots deep in the eighteenth century.

Robert A. Caro,Master of the Senate,2002,"The room on the first floor of the Barbour County Courthouse in the little town of Eufaula, Alabama, was normally the County Clerk’s Office, but after it had closed for the day on August 2, 1957, it was being used by the county’s Board of Registrars, the body that registered citizens so they could vote in elections—not that the Board was going to register any of the three persons who were applying that day, for the skin of these applicants was black."

John Kenneth Galbraith,The New York Times,,"Truth, not unconvincing humility, is the grandest virtue and accordingly I may observe that I am better qualified than any man alive to review a book on the public life of Chester Bowles."
Martin Gardner,The New York Times,,"Biographical history, as taught in our public schools, is still largely a history of boneheads: ridiculous kings and queens, paranoid political leaders, compulsive voyagers, ignorant generals—the flotsam and jetsam of historical currents. The men who radically altered history, the great creative scientists and mathematicians, are seldom mentioned if at all."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"It must have been a gas, to borrow one of his favorite terms, to get a letter from Terry Southern. Each was its own little acid trip, streaked with innuendo and poached in a satirical kind of intellectual flop sweat. He used thin, expensive paper and sealed some of his letters with wax. People were said to read them aloud to whoever was in the room."
Peter Gay,Mozart,1999,The life of Mozart is the triumph of genius over precociousness.
Doris Kearns Goodwin,Leadership in Turbulent Times,2018,"Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, and Lyndon Johnson—the lives and times of these four men have occupied me for half a century.

Adam Gopnik,Angels and Ages,2009,"We are all pebbles dropped in the sea of history, where the splash strikes one way and the big tides run another, and though what we feel is the splash, the splash takes place only within those tides.

Laura Hillenbrand,Seabiscuit,2001,"In 1938, near the end of a decade of monumental turmoil, the year’s number-one newsmaker was not Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Hitler, or Mussolini. It wasn’t Pope Pius XI, nor was it Lou Gehrig, Howard Hughes, or Clark Gable. The subject of the most newspaper column inches in 1938 wasn’t even a person. It was an undersized, crooked-legged racehorse named Seabiscuit."

M. G. Lord,The Accidental Feminist,2012,"You could say it began in 1944 with National Velvet, when Elizabeth Taylor, age twelve, dressed as a boy and stole America’s collective heart.

Mark Manson,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,2016,"Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet.

Rod Serling,Los Angeles Times,,"There is a bitter sadness and special irony that attends the passing of Martin Luther King. Quickly and with ease, we offer up a chorus of posthumous praise—the ritual dirge so time-honored and comfortable and undemanding of anything but rhetoric. In death, we offer the acknowledgement of the man and his dream that we denied him in life."

Patti Smith,Just Kids,2010,"I was asleep when he died. I had called the hospital to say one more good night, but he had gone under, beneath layers of morphine. I held the receiver and listened to his labored breathing through the phone, knowing I would never hear him again."
Howard Sounes,Charles Bukowski,1998,"Charles Bukowski raised himself up from his chair and got a beer from the refrigerator behind him on stage.

Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine,Last Chance to See,1990,"Assumptions are the things you don’t know you’re making, which is why it is so disorienting the first time you take the plug out of a wash-basin in Australia and see the water spiraling down the hole the other way around. The very laws of physics are telling you how far you are from home."
Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine,Last Chance to See,1990,"If you took the whole of Norway, scrunched it up a bit, shook out all the moose and reindeer, hurled it ten thousand miles around the world, and filled it with birds, then you’d be wasting your time, because it looks very much as if someone has already done it."
Mortimer J. Adler,The Saturday Review of Literature,,"You know you have to read “between the lines” to get the most out of anything.

Roger Angell,The New Yorker,,"Check me out. The top two knuckles of my left hand look as if I’d been worked over by the K.G.B. No, it’s more as if I’d been a catcher for the Hall of Fame pitcher Candy Cummings, the inventor of the curveball, who retired from the game in 1877. To put this another way, if I pointed that hand at you like a pistol and fired at your nose, the bullet would nail you in the left knee. Arthritis."
Natalie Angier,The New York Times Magazine,,"Life is short but jingles are forever: none more so, it seems, than the familiar ditty, variously attributed to William James, Ogden Nash and Dorothy Parker: ""Hoggamus, higgamus,/Men are polygamous,/Higgamus, hoggamus,/Women monogamous."""

James Atlas,The New York Times,,"“The moment one begins to investigate the truth of the simplest facts which one has accepted as true,“ wrote Leonard Woolf in his autobiography, “it is as though one had stepped off a firm narrow path into a bog or quicksand—every step one takes one sinks deeper into the bog of uncertainty.“"

Christopher Buckley,Forbes Life,2014,"My wife, in her wisdom, decreed that we must have a fish tank in our bathroom. Like Rumpole of the Bailey, I refer to my darling as She Who Must Be Obeyed. So the only answer was “Darling, what an excellent idea. I am so excited to have fish in our bathroom.”"

They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than this futile and hopeless labor."

Find that missing sock. Pick up the rogue crayon that rolled under the table. Throw my hair in a ponytail before getting my son from his crib. After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second."

Jacqueline Faber,Writer’s Digest,,"If the salesperson’s edict is to “always be closing,” the writer’s first mandate is to nail the opening. When it works, it feels like alchemy.

John Ficara,The Washington Post,,"The English language has something to confuse or annoy just about anyone—the mysteries of who and whom usage, the e.g. vs. i.e. standoff, the polarizing Oxford comma.

Martin Gardner,The New York Times,,"Biographical history, as taught in our public schools, is still largely a history of boneheads: ridiculous kings and queens, paranoid political leaders, compulsive voyagers, ignorant generals—the flotsam and jetsam of historical currents. The men who radically altered history, the great creative scientists and mathematicians, are seldom mentioned if at all."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"It must have been a gas, to borrow one of his favorite terms, to get a letter from Terry Southern.

People were said to read them aloud to whoever was in the room."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour, is about a young woman who turns into a leaf. “Unrequited love’s a bore,” Billie Holiday sang. So, it turns out, is photosynthesis."

In other words: beautiful."
Elizabeth Gilbert,Esquire,,"I was not the prettiest bartender at the Coyote Ugly Saloon. In my opinion, that would have been Caroline.

David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"To some philosophers it appears [a] matter of surprise that all mankind, possessing the same nature and being endowed with the same faculties, should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations, and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by the other."
David Hume,"Essays: Moral, Political, &amp; Literary",,"Political writers have established it as a maxim that, in contriving any system of government…every man ought to be supposed a knave, and to have no other end in all his actions than private interest."

Nigel Jaquiss,Willamette Week,,"Joe Gilliam, one of the most influential voices in Oregon politics, has been silenced. For more than two decades, Gilliam, 59, served as president of the Northwest Grocery Association, which counts Fred Meyer, Safeway and Costco among its members. He represented their interests in Salem, battled competitors and earned a reputation as a punishing opponent and loyal friend. But for the past nine months, WW recently learned, Gilliam has been lying in a vegetative state at an undisclosed care facility in Clark County, Wash.

Phillip Lopate,To Show and To Tell,2013,"I should explain straight-out that I consider myself to be as much a teacher as writer. It’s not simply that a good deal of my annual income derives from teaching; it’s also that I find it a fascinating challenge, one that nourishes my psyche—and my own writing."

Mary McCarthy,Partisan Review,,Every age has a keyhole to which its eye is pasted.
Mary McCarthy,The New Yorker,,"Teaching for the wisest of the ancients, was only a form of prompting. Socrates’ pupils, who sought to know what was love, what was justice, what was beauty, and so on, were shown by the philosopher that they already knew the answers to these questions, though they did not know they knew them…."
Mary McCarthy,Harper’s,1961,"“Pour it on, Colonel,” cried the young man in the Dacron suit excitedly, making his first sortie into the club-car conversation. His face was white as Roquefort and of a glistening, cheeselike texture; he had a shock of tow-colored hair, badly cut and greasy, and a snub nose with large gray pores. Under his darting eyes were two black craters."

Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I have been bird hunting since I was ten years old.

Sometimes so ashamed that I lie about it vividly and recklessly."

Thomas McGuane,An Outside Chance: Essays of Sport,1980,"I concede that “mutton snapper” is hardly a prepossessing title. The sheep, from which the name derives, is not much of an animal. No civilized person deals with him except in chops and stews. To bleat is not to sing out in a commanding baritone; to be sheepish is scarcely to possess a virtue for which civilization rolls out its more impressive carpets."

Lance Morrow,The Wall Street Journal,,"I once knew a magazine journalist who was addicted to metaphors. He was, so to speak, an alcoholic of metaphors. If he took one sip from the demon rum of analogy, he would be in the gutter by the end of the paragraph. His journalism suffered from what might be called cirrhosis of the prose."
Kate Murphy,The News &amp; Observer,,"I signed up to serve on the media review committee for my middle daughter’s public school library.

Joshua Prager,Roe,,"Nearly half a century ago, Roe v. Wade secured a woman’s legal right to obtain an abortion. The ruling has been contested with ever-increasing intensity, dividing and reshaping American politics.

Ernie Pyle,New York World-Telegram,,"I took a walk along the historic coast of Normandy in the country of France. It was a lovely day for strolling along the seashore.

Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"If you want me to name in one sentence what is wrong with the modern world, I will say that never before has the world been clamoring so desperately for answers to crucial problems—and never before has the world been so frantically committed to the belief that no answers are possible."
Ayn Rand,The Los Angeles Times,1990,"The death of Marilyn Monroe shocked people with an impact different from their reaction to the death of any other movie star or public figure.

Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"“God grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change, courage to change things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.” This remarkable statement is attributed to a theologian with whose ideas I disagree in every fundamental respect: Reinhold Niebuhr. But—omitting the form of a prayer, i.e., the implication that one’s mental-emotional states are a gift from God—that statement is profoundly true, as a summary and a guideline: It names the mental attitude which a rational man must seek to achieve.”"
Ayn Rand,"Philosophy, Who Needs It",1982,"The most appropriate title for this discussion would be “I told you so.” But since that would be in somewhat dubious taste, I shall leave this untitled."
Rhonda Rich,The New Brunswick News,,"On a Sunday morning, tucked into bed on the island of St. Simons, the place where I, at the age of 13, accepted the calling that had haunted me since I was four — that of becoming a writer—Tink brought me a copy of The New York Times and coffee loaded with cream."

Tom Robbins,Playboy,2005,"Kissing is our greatest invention. On the list of great inventions, it ranks higher than the Thermos bottle and the Airstream trailer; higher, even, than room service, possibly because the main reason room service was created was so people could stay in bed and kiss without going hungry."
Salman Rushdie,The New Yorker,,"1989. Afterward, when the world was exploding around him, he felt annoyed with himself for having forgotten the name of the BBC reporter who told him that his old life was over and a new, darker existence was about to begin. She called him at home, on his private line, without explaining how she got the number. “How does it feel,” she asked him, “to know that you have just been sentenced to death by Ayatollah Khomeini?”"
Bertrand Russell,The Dial,,"Moralists, in the main, have been a somewhat forbidding race. Their main preoccupation has usually been to try to prevent people from doing that they wanted to do, on the ground—formerly explicit, but now seldom avowed—that the natural man is wicked."

Peter Schjeldahl,The Village Voice,,"At a dinner party recently, a nice young political consultant rhapsodized to me about the portent of the millennium, in which he saw the dawn of, yes, a New Age. I wasn’t having it. I remarked that scholars now date the birth of Jesus to about 6 B.C., so the millennium passed already."
Peter Schjeldahl,The New Yorker,,"Lung cancer, rampant. No surprise. I’ve smoked since I was sixteen, behind the high-school football bleachers in Northfield, Minnesota.

Rod Serling,Los Angeles Times,,"There is a bitter sadness and special irony that attends the passing of Martin Luther King. Quickly and with ease, we offer up a chorus of posthumous praise—the ritual dirge so time-honored and comfortable and undemanding of anything but rhetoric. In death, we offer the acknowledgement of the man and his dream that we denied him in life."
Josh Shaffer,News &amp; Observer,,"To the ears of a musical novice, the tuba ranks lowest in the family of instruments—an oafish cousin with a voice like a bullfrog. It lacks the flash of a saxophone, the brashness of a trumpet or the showiness of a piccolo—the melodic equivalent of a St. Bernard, warbling from the orchestra’s back row."

Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"It was a key match in the World Cup of Ideas. The teams vied furiously for the ball.

Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"One evening over dinner in March 2008, I began to joke, as I often had before, about writing an essay called “Men Explain Things to Me.” Every writer has a stable of ideas that never make it to the racetrack, and I’d been trotting this pony out recreationally once in a while."

Calvin Trillin,The New Yorker,,"It’s said that when James Thurber, as a young newspaper reporter, was told by an editor that his story’s first paragraph, what newspaper people might refer to as his lede, suffered from wordiness, he handed in a rewrite whose opening paragraph was, in its entirety, “Dead.” There followed a second paragraph: “That’s what the man was when they found him with a knife in his back at 4pm in front of Riley’s saloon at the corner of 52nd and 12th streets.”"
Kenneth Tynan,The Observer,1964,"Nobody has ever succeeded as Macbeth, and the reason is not far to seek. Instead of growing as the play proceeds, the hero shrinks; complex and many-levelled to begin with, he ends up a cornered thug, lacking even a death scene with which to regain lost stature."

Laurel Thatcher Ulrich,American Quarterly,2007,"Cotton Mather called them “The hidden ones.“ They never preached or sat in a deacon’s bench. Nor did they vote or attend Harvard. Neither, because they were virtuous women, did they question God or the magistrates. They prayed secretly, read the Bible through at least once a year, and went to hear the minister preach even when it snowed. Hoping for an eternal crown, they never asked to be remembered on earth. And they haven’t been. Well-behaved women seldom make history."

H. G. Wells,Certain Personal Matters,1898,"The art of the essayist is so simple, so entirely free from canons of criticism, and withal so delightful, that one must needs wonder why all men are not essayists.

And all the rest is as easy as wandering among woodlands on a bright morning in the spring."
George F. Will,The Washington Post,1997,"A reader demands to know how I contracted the infectious conservatism for which he plans to horsewhip me.

There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.

Carlo Collodi,The Adventures of Pinocchio,1883,"Centuries ago there lived— “A king!“ my little readers will say immediately. No, children, you are mistaken. Once upon a time there was a piece of wood. It was not an expensive piece of wood. Far from it. Just a common block of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm. I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter. His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry. As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy. Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself: “This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of a table.” He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood. But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone: “Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!”"
Roald Dahl,James and the Giant Peach,1961,"Until he was four years old, James Henry Trotter had had a happy life. He lived peacefully with his mother and father in a beautiful house beside the sea.

Roald Dahl,Matilda,1988,"It’s a funny thing about mothers and fathers.

Felix Salten,Bambi,1928,"He came into the world in the middle of the thicket, in one of those little, hidden forest glades which seem to be entirely open, but are really screened in on all sides. There was very little room in it, scarcely enough for him and his mother."

Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook, overhung by a steep bank."
Dodie Smith,The Hundred and One Dalmatians,1956,"Not long ago, there lived in London a young married couple of Dalmatian dogs named Pongo and Missis Pongo.

Natalie Babbitt,Tuck Everlasting,1975,"The first week of August hangs at the very top of summer, the top of the live-long year, like the highest seat of a Ferris wheel when it pauses in its turning. The weeks that come before are only a climb from balmy spring, and those that follow a drop to the chill of autumn, but the first week of August is motionless, and hot."

L. Frank Baum,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1900,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife.

Suzanne Collins,Catching Fire,2009,"I clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air. My muscles are clenched tight against the cold.

Suzanne Collins,Mockingjay,2010,"I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather. This is where the bed I shared with my sister, Prim, stood.

Gillian Flynn,Gone Girl,2012,"When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it. Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil. She had what the Victorians would call a finely shaped head. You could imagine the skull quite easily. I’d know her head anywhere."

John Green,Looking for Alaska,2005,"The week before I left my family and Florida and the rest of my minor life to go to boarding school in Alabama, my mother insisted on throwing me a going-away party. To say that I had low expectations would be to underestimate the matter dramatically."
John Green,The Fault is in Our Stars,2012,"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death."

Mark Haddon,The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,2003,"It was 7 minutes after midnight. The dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears’s house.

John Irving,A Prayer for Owen Meany,1989,"I am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice—not because of his voice, or because he was the smallest person I ever knew, or even because he was the instrument of my mother’s death, but because he is the reason I believe in God; I am a Christian because of Owen Meany."
John Irving,Last Night in Twisted River,2009,"The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long. For a frozen moment, his feet had stopped moving on the floating logs in the basin above the river bend; he’d slipped entirely underwater before anyone could grab his outstretched hand."
John Irving,In One Person,2012,"I’m going to begin by telling you about Miss Frost. While I say to everyone that I became a writer because I read a certain novel by Charles Dickens at the formative age of fifteen, the truth is I was younger than that when I first met Miss Frost and imagined having sex with her, and this moment of my sexual awakening also marked the fitful birth of my imagination."
Washington Irving,The Sketch Book,,"Whoever has made a voyage up the Hudson, must remember the Kaatskill mountains.

Washington Irving,The Sketch Book,,"In the bosom of one of the spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail, and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town of rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town."
Shirley Jackson,We Have Always Lived in the Castle,1962,"My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had.

Lauren Kate,The Betrayal of Natalie Hargrove,2009,"Once upon a time you knew nothing. It wasn’t your fault—you were just a kid.

Sue Monk Kidd,The Secret Life of Bees,2002,"At night I would lie in bed and watch the show, how bees squeezed through the cracks of my bedroom wall and flew circles around the room, making that propeller sound, a high-pitched zzzzzz that hummed along my skin. I watched their wings shining like bits of chrome in the dark and felt the longing build in my chest. The way those bees flew, not even looking for a flower, just flying for the feel of the wind, split my heart down its seam."

Anne Lamott,Crooked Little Heart,1997,"Rosie and her friends were blooming like spring, budding, lithe, agile as cats. They wore tiny dresses and skirts so short that their frilly satin tennis bloomers showed."
Anne Lamott,Imperfect Birds,2010,"There are so many evils that pull on our children. Even in the mellow town of Landsdale, where it is easy to see only beauty and decency, a teenager died nearly every year after a party and kids routinely went from high school to psych wards, halfway houses, or jail. Once a year a child from the county of Marin jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge."

Harper Lee,To Kill a Mockingbird,1961,"When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt."
Mackenzi Lee,The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue,2017,"On the morning we are to leave for our Grand Tour of the Continent, I wake up in bed beside Percy. For a disorienting moment, it’s unclear whether we’ve slept together or simply slept together."

David Mitchell,Black Swan Green,2006,"Do not set foot in my office. That’s Dad’s rule. But the phone’d rung twenty-five times. Normal people give up after ten or eleven, unless it’s a matter of life or death. Don’t they?"
David Mitchell,The Bone Clocks,2014,"I fling open my bedroom curtains, and there’s the thirsty sky and the wide river full of ships and boats and stuff, but I’m already thinking of Vinny’s chocolaty eyes, shampoo down Vinny’s back, beads of sweat on Vinny’s shoulders, and Vinny’s sly laugh, and by now my heart’s going mental and, God, I wish I was waking up at Vinny’s place in Peacock Street and not in my own stupid bedroom."

Delia Owens,Where the Crawdads Sing,2018,"The morning burned so August-hot, the marsh’s moist breath hung the oaks and pines with fog.

J. D. Salinger,The Catcher in the Rye,1951,"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth."

Sam Savage,Firmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife,2006,"I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov’s “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins”; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy’s “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier: “This is the saddest story I have ever heard.” I’ve read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off. Ford Madox Ford was a Big One."
Erica Lorraine Scheit,Uses for Boys,2013,"In the happy times, in the tell-me-again times, when I’m seven and there are no stepbrothers and it’s before the stepfathers, my mom lets me sleep in her bed. Her bed is a raft on the ocean. It’s a cloud, a forest, a spaceship, a cocoon we share. I stretch out big as I can, a five-pointed star, and she bundles me back up in her arms. When I wake I’m tangled in her hair. “Tell me again,” I say and she tells me again how she wanted me more than anything. “More than anything in the world,” she says, “I wanted a little girl.”"
Anna Sewell,Black Beauty,1877,"The first place that I can well remember was a pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook, overhung by a steep bank."
Alan Sillitoe,The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner,1959,"As soon as I got to Borstal they made me a long-distance cross-country runner. I suppose they thought I was just the build for it because I was long and skinny for my age (and still am) and in any case I didn’t mind it much, to tell you the truth, because running had always been made much of in our family, especially running away from the police."
Andrew Smith,Winger,2013,"I said a silent prayer. Actually, silent is the only type of prayer a guy should attempt when his head’s in a toilet."
Andrew Smith,100 Sideways Miles,2014,"Look: I do not know where I actually came from. I wonder, I suspect, but I do not know. I am not the only one who sometimes thinks I came from the pages of a book my father wrote. Maybe it’s like that for all boys of a certain—or uncertain—age: We feel as though there are no choices we’d made through all those miles and miles behind us that hadn’t been scripted by our fathers, and that our futures are only a matter of flipping the next page that was written ahead of us. I am not the only one who’s ever been trapped inside a book."
Andrew Smith,Grasshopper Jungle,2014,"I read somewhere that human beings are genetically predisposed to record history. We believe it will prevent us from doing stupid things in the future. But even though we dutifully archived elaborate records of everything we’ve ever done, we also managed to keep on doing dumber and dumber shit. This is my history."
Dodie Smith,I Capture The Castle,1949,I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.
Robert Louis Stevenson,Treasure Island,1883,"Squire Trelawney, Dr Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17—and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow Inn and the brown old seaman, with the sabre cut, first took up his lodging under our roof."
Nina Stibbe,Man at the Helm,2014,My sister and I and our little brother were born (in that order) into a very good situation and apart from the odd new thing life was humdrum and comfortable until an evening in 1970 when our mother listened in to our father’s phone call and ended up blowing her nose on a tea towel—a thing she’d only have done in an absolute emergency.

Donna Tartt,The Little Friend,2002,"For the rest of her life, Charlotte Cleve would blame herself for her son’s death because she had decided to have the Mother’s Day dinner at six in the evening instead of noon, after church, which is when the Cleves usually had it."

Angie Thomas,Concrete Rose,2021,"When it comes to the streets, there’s rules. They ain’t written down, and you won’t find them in a book. It’s natural stuff you know the moment your momma let you out the house. Kinda like you know how to breathe without somebody telling you."

Mark Twain,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,1884,"You don’t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by a Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.”"
Mark Twain,The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg and Other Stories and Sketches,1900,"The dreams of my boyhood? No, they have not been realized. For all who are old, there is something infinitely pathetic about the subject you have chosen, for in no gray-head’s case can it suggest any but one thing—disappointment."
Mark Twain,The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg and Other Stories and Sketches,1900,"As I understand it, what you desire is information about “my first lie, and how I got out of it.”"
Mark Twain,The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg and Other Stories and Sketches,1900,"It was many years ago. Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright town in all the region round about. It had kept that reputation unsmirched during three generations, and was prouder of it than of any other of its possessions."
Mark Twain,The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg and Other Stories and Sketches,1900,Monday —This new creature with the long hair is a good deal in the way. It is always hanging around and following me about. I don’t like this; I am not used to company. I wish it would stay with the other animals.

Suzie Yang,White Ivy,2020,Ivy Lin was a thief but you would never know it to look at her. Maybe that was the problem. No one ever suspected—and that made her reckless.
Jane Yolen,How to Fracture a Fairy Tale,2018,"They call the white flower that covers the lawn like a poplin carpet Snow in Summer. And because I was born in July with a white caul on my head, they called me that, too. Mama wanted me to answer to Summer, which is a warm, pretty name. But my Stepmamma, who took me in hand just six months after mama passed away, only spoke the single syllable of my name, and she didn’t say it nicely."

Isaac Asimov,"I, Robot",1950,I looked at my notes and I didn’t like them. I’d spent three days at U. S. Robots and might as well have spent them at home with the Encyclopedia Tellurica.
Isaac Asimov,The Robots of Dawn,1983,"Elijah Baley found himself in the shade of the tree and muttered to himself, “I knew it. I’m sweating.“ He paused, straightened up, wiped the perspiration from his brow with the back of his hand, then looked dourly at the moisture that covered it. I hate sweating,“ he said to no one, throwing it out as a cosmic law. And once again he felt annoyance with the Universe for making something both essential and unpleasant."
Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg,Nightfall,1990,It was a dazzling four-sun afternoon.
Margaret Atwood,The Blind Assassin,2000,"Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge. The bridge was being repaired: she went right through the Danger sign. The car fell a hundred feet into the ravine, smashing through the treetops feathery with new leaves, then burst into flames and rolled down into the shallow creek at the bottom. Chunks of the bridge fell on top of it. Nothing much was left of her but charred smithereens."
Margaret Atwood,Oryx and Crake,2003,"Snowman wakes before dawn. He lies unmoving, listening to the tide come in, wave after wave sloshing over the various barricades, wish-wash, wish-wash, the rhythm of heartbeat. He would so like to believe he is still asleep."
Margaret Atwood,The Heart Goes Last,2015,"Sleeping in the car is cramped. Being a third-hand Honda, it's no palace to begin with. If it was a van they'd have more room, but fat chance of affording one of those, even back when they thought they had money. Stan says they're lucky to have any kind of a car at all, which is true, but their luckiness doesn't make the car any bigger."

Fredric Brown,Thrilling Wonder Stories,1903,"There is a sweet little horror story that is only two sentences long: The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door... Two sentences and an ellipsis of three dots. The horror, of course, isn’t in the story at all; it’s in the ellipsis, the implication: what knocked at the door. Faced with the unknown, the human mind supplies something vaguely horrible. But it wasn’t horrible, really."
Samuel Butler,Erewhon,1872,"If the reader will excuse me, I will say nothing of my antecedents, nor of the circumstances that led me to leave my native country; the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself."

Neil Gaiman,American Gods,2001,"Shadow had done three years in prison. He was big enough and looked don’t-fuck-with-me enough that his biggest problem was killing time. So he kept himself in shape, and thought a lot about how much he loved his wife."
David Gerrold,Worlds of Wonder,2018,"The very best writing instructor I ever had was an incompetent. A terminal alcoholic who could barely find the classroom each day, he was a bleary-eyed, red-nosed, overstuffed, walking elbow-wrinkle of a human being. Whatever writing ability he’d ever had, he’d long since drowned it, and the corpse was a layer of dried sediment at the bottom of a bottle. He didn’t like me either."

Colleen Gleason (see also Colleen Cambridge entry),The Clockwork Scarab,2013,"There are a limited number of excuses for a young, intelligent woman of seventeen to be traversing the fog-shrouded streets of London at midnight.

Haruki Murakami,Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World,1985,"The elevator continued its impossibly slow ascent. Or at least I imagined it was ascent. There was no telling for sure: it was so slow that all sense of direction simply vanished. It could have been going down for all I knew, or maybe it wasn’t moving at all. But let’s just assume it was going up. Merely a guess. Maybe I’d gone up twelve stories, then down three. Maybe I’d circled the globe. How would I know?"
Audrey Niffenegger,The Time Traveller’s Wife,2003,"It’s hard being left behind. I wait for Henry, not knowing where he is, wondering if he’s okay. It’s hard to be the one who stays."
Audrey Niffennegger,Her Fearful Symmetry,2009,"Elspeth died while Robert was standing in front of a vending machine watching tea shoot into a small plastic cup. Later he would remember walking down the hospital corridor with the cup of horrible tea in his hand, alone under the fluorescent lights, retracing his steps to the room where Elspeth lay surrounded by machines. She had turned her head towards the door and her eyes were open; at first Robert thought she was conscious."
Arturo Pérez-Reverte,The Club Dumas,2003,"The flash projected the outline of the hanged man onto the wall. He hung motionless from a light fixture in the center of the room, and as the photographer moved around him, taking pictures, the flashes threw the silhouette onto a succession of paintings, glass cabinets full of porcelain, shelves of books, open curtains framing great windows beyond which the rain was falling."

Terry Pratchett,Night Watch,2002,"Sam Vimes sighed when he heard the scream, but finished shaving before doing anything about it."
Carl Sagan,Contact,1985,"When they pulled her out, she was not crying at all. Her tiny brow was wrinkled, and then her eyes grew wide. She looked at the bright lights, the white-and green-clad figures, the woman lying on the table below her. Somehow familiar sounds washed over her. On her face was an odd expression for a newborn—puzzlement perhaps."
John Scalzi,Old Man’s War,2005,I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife’s grave. Then I joined the army.
John Scalzi,Redshirts,2012,"From the top of the large boulder he sat on, Ensign Tom Davis looked across the expanse of the cave toward Captain Lucius Abernathy, Science Officer Q’eeng and Chief Engineer Paul West perched on a second, larger boulder and thought, Well, this sucks."
Walter Tevis,The Man Who Fell to Earth,1963,"After two miles of walking he came to a town. At the town’s edge was a sign that read Haneyville: Pop. 1400. That was good, a good size. It was still early in the morning—he had chosen morning for the two-mile walk, because it was cooler then—and there was no one yet in the streets. He walked for several blocks in the weak light, confused at the strangeness—tense and somewhat frightened. He tried not to think of what he was going to do. He had thought about it enough already. In the small business district he found what he wanted, a tiny store called The Jewel Box. On the street corner nearby was a green wooden bench, and he went to it and seated himself, his body aching from the labor of the long walk. It was a few minutes later that he saw a human being."

H. G. Wells,The Time Machine,1895,The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was expounding a recondite matter to us.
H. G. Wells,The War of the Worlds,1898,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were being scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water."
Martha Wells,All Systems Red,2017,"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don’t know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure."

Mitch Albom,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,2003,"This is a story about a man named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie dying in the sun. It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time."
Mitch Albom,For One More Day,2006,"“Let me guess. You want to know why I tried to kill myself.“ — Chick Benetto’s first words to me. This is a story about a family and, as there is a ghost involved, you might call it a ghost story. But every family is a ghost story. The dead sit at our tables long after they have gone."

Isabel Allende,The Wind Knows My Name,2023,"Vienna, November 1938 A sense of misfortune hung in the air. From the early morning hours, a menacing breeze had swept through the streets, whistling between the buildings, forcing its way in through the cracks under doors and windows. “Just winter settling in,” Rudolph Adler murmured to himself in an attempt to lighten his mood. But he couldn’t blame the weather for the tightness in his chest, which he’d felt for several months now."
Hans Christian Andersen,,1835,"There was once a woman who did so want to have a wee child of her own, but she had no idea where she was to get it from. So she went off to an old witch and said to her, “I would so dearly like to have a little child. Do please tell me where I can find one.“"
Hans Christian Andersen,,1837,"Far out at sea the water’s as blue as the petals of the loveliest cornflower, and as clear as the purest glass; but it’s very deep, deeper than any anchor can reach.

Kate Atkinson,Behind the Scenes at the Museum,1995,"I exist! I am conceived to the chimes of midnight on the clock on the mantelpiece in the room across the hall. The clock once belonged to my great-grandmother (a woman called Alice) and its tired chime counts me into the world.

Natalie Babbitt,Tuck Everlasting,1975,"The first week of August hangs at the very top of summer, the top of the live-long year, like the highest seat of a Ferris wheel when it pauses in its turning.

L. Frank Baum,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,1900,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife.

There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cooking stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner."

William Peter Blatty,The Exorcist,1971,"Like the brief doomed flare of exploding suns that registers dimly on blind men’s eyes, the beginning of the horror passed almost unnoticed; in the shriek of what followed, in fact, was forgotten and perhaps not connected to the horror at all. What looked like morning was the beginning of endless night."
Jorge Luis Borges,The Aleph and Other Stories,1949,"On the burning February morning Beatriz Viterbo died, after braving an agony that never for a single moment gave way to self-pity or fear, I noticed that the sidewalk billboards around Constitution Plaza were advertising some new brand or other of American cigarettes."
Ray Bradbury,Dark Carnival,1947,"There was any amount of banging and hammering for a number of days; deliveries of metal parts and oddments which Mr. Charles Braling took into his little workshop with a feverish anxiety.

Richard Brautigan,Sombrero Fallout,1976,"“A sombrero fell out of the sky and landed on the Main Street of town in front of the mayor, his cousin and a person out of work. The day was scrubbed clean by the desert air. The sky was blue. It was the blue of human eyes, waiting for something to happen. There was no reason for a sombrero to fall out of the sky. No airplane or helicopter was passing overhead and it was not a religious holiday.”"

From the prisoners’ hold they take me through the gallery, down the stairs and past the table crawling with barristers and clerks.

Suzanne Collins,Mockingjay,2010,"I stare down at my shoes, watching as a fine layer of ash settles on the worn leather. This is where the bed I shared with my sister, Prim, stood.

How else could I orient myself in this sea of gray?"
Carlo Collodi,The Adventures of Pinocchio,1883,"Centuries ago there lived— “A king!“ my little readers will say immediately. No, children, you are mistaken. Once upon a time there was a piece of wood. It was not an expensive piece of wood. Far from it. Just a common block of firewood, one of those thick, solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm. I do not know how this really happened, yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter. His real name was Mastro Antonio, but everyone called him Mastro Cherry, for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry. As soon as he saw that piece of wood, Mastro Cherry was filled with joy. Rubbing his hands together happily, he mumbled half to himself: “This has come in the nick of time. I shall use it to make the leg of a table.” He grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood. But as he was about to give it the first blow, he stood still with arm uplifted, for he had heard a wee, little voice say in a beseeching tone: “Please be careful! Do not hit me so hard!”"

Laurie Ezpeleta,Buried Mistakes,2014,"That night I dreamed. Someone’s at the door. I don’t want to open it. But I must. A young soldier stands before me, trembling. I nod and he follows me into the tiny room. I light the lamp so I can see him better. Then I sit on the small wooden crate that contains my belongings and wait. He kneels on the floor before me, his body tense as the strings on the shamisen I used to play. “The fighting was close today,” I say to him. The soldier looks frightened—they all do. He nods and bows his head. But I have already looked into his eyes—eyes that have seen too much. He reaches for me and I flinch. It’s a mistake. His eyes flash as the wounded beast within him roars. He hits me, striking at me with all of his pent up rage. Then he rapes me."

The man sat facing my daughters Clarissa and Jenny and me, the three of us squeezed together across from him and Danny in the seat beside him. I could understand my son’s curiosity.

J. K. Rowling,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,1999,"Harry Potter was a very unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year.

Carl Sagan,Contact,1985,"When they pulled her out, she was not crying at all. Her tiny brow was wrinkled, and then her eyes grew wide.

That is exactly what I refused to do, you see."
Sam Savage,Firmin: Adventures of a Metropolitan Lowlife,2006,"I had always imagined that my life story, if and when I wrote it, would have a great first line: something lyric like Nabokov’s “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins”; or if I could not do lyric, then something sweeping like Tolstoy’s “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” People remember those words even when they have forgotten everything else about the books. When it comes to openers, though, the best in my view has to be the beginning of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier: “This is the saddest story I have ever heard.” I’ve read that one dozens of times and it still knocks my socks off.

Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master’s house, which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees, and at the bottom a running brook, overhung by a steep bank."
Laurence Shames,The Paradise Gig,2020,"Well, the whole thing started with a woman standing on her head. She was doing this yoga-style, on Smathers Beach in Key West, Florida, just a few short weeks ago. It was a beautifully ordinary day, sunny with a salty breeze. She was minding her own business, upside down, when two men suddenly approached her towel. They might have pushed her over but it’s hard to say for sure. Anyway, she came down off her head, left the beach with them, and wasn’t seen for several days. After that, a bunch of crazy stuff happened, and seemed to happen very fast."
Laurence Shames,Relative Humidity,,"Now and then, not often, life offers up a perfect moment, a moment when everything just fits together, almost as if there was a plan, as if the world had been designed to be at least an occasional Paradise for those who took the trouble to notice its ingenious construction, as if life would be a calm and peaceful pleasure if that moment just went on and on. But of course it never does."

On top, a contorted mass was somehow pinned or perched."

It was still early in the morning—he had chosen morning for the two-mile walk, because it was cooler then—and there was no one yet in the streets. He walked for several blocks in the weak light, confused at the strangeness—tense and somewhat frightened. He tried not to think of what he was going to do. He had thought about it enough already. In the small business district he found what he wanted, a tiny store called The Jewel Box. On the street corner nearby was a green wooden bench, and he went to it and seated himself, his body aching from the labor of the long walk. It was a few minutes later that he saw a human being."

H. G. Wells,The War of the Worlds,1898,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were being scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water."
Martha Wells,All Systems Red,2017,"I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites.

Rachel Yoder,Nightbitch: A Novel,2021,"When she had referred to herself as Nightbitch, she meant it as a good-natured self-deprecating joke—because that’s the sort of lady she was, a good sport, able to poke fun at herself, definitely not uptight, not wound really tight, not so freakishly tight that she couldn’t see the humor in a light-hearted not-meant-as-an-insult situation—but in the days following this new naming, she found the patch of coarse black hair sprouting from the base of her neck and was, like, What the fuck."

Henry N. Beard and Douglas C. Kenney,Bored of the Rings,1969,"""Do you like what you doth see...?"" said the voluptuous elf-maiden as she provocatively parted the folds of her robe to reveal the rounded, shadowy glories within. Frito's throat was dry, though his head reeled with desire and ale."

G. K. Chesterton,The Autobiography of G. K. Chesterton,1936,"Bowing down in blind credulity, as is my custom, before mere authority and the tradition of the elders, superstitiously swallowing a story I could not test at the time by experiment or private judgment, I am firmly of the opinion that I was born on the 29th of May, 1874, on Campden Hill, Kensington."

John Ficara,The Washington Post,,"The English language has something to confuse or annoy just about anyone—the mysteries of who and whom usage, the e.g. vs. i.e. standoff, the polarizing Oxford comma.

"Scott L. Gardner, Judy Diamond, &amp; Gabor Racz",Parasites,2022,"Parasites are rarely described in positive terms. They are seen as blood suckers, freeloaders, scroungers, flunkies, deadbeats, and the worst kind of groupies."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"It must have been a gas, to borrow one of his favorite terms, to get a letter from Terry Southern. Each was its own little acid trip, streaked with innuendo and poached in a satirical kind of intellectual flop sweat. He used thin, expensive paper and sealed some of his letters with wax. People were said to read them aloud to whoever was in the room."
Dwight Garner,The New York Times,,"Sheila Heti’s new novel, Pure Colour, is about a young woman who turns into a leaf. “Unrequited love’s a bore,” Billie Holiday sang. So, it turns out, is photosynthesis."

John Green,Looking for Alaska,2005,"The week before I left my family and Florida and the rest of my minor life to go to boarding school in Alabama, my mother insisted on throwing me a going-away party. To say that I had low expectations would be to underestimate the matter dramatically."
John Green,The Fault is in Our Stars,2012,"Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death."

Joseph Heller,Catch-22,1961,It was love at first sight.
O. Henry,The Four Million,1906,"It was a day in March. Never, never begin a story this way when you write one. No opening could possibly be worse. It is unimaginative, flat, dry and likely to consist of mere wind. But in this instance it is allowable."

Alfred Hitchcock,Alfred Hitchcock Presents,1973,In previous anthologies I have often begun my introduction with the words “Good Evening.” In all good conscience I cannot do that now.

Molly Ivins,Fort-Worth Star-Telegram,,"Great Caesar’s armpit! Sweet suffering catfish! Holey Gamoley! I have been to the Pyramids of America. I have seen the cathedral of commerce, our Coliseum, our Chartres. I have been to the Mall of America, the world’s largest shopping mall."

Jonas Jonasson,The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,2009,"You might think he could have made up his mind earlier, and been man enough to inform his surroundings of his decision. But Allan Karlsson had never been given to pondering things too long. So the idea had barely taken hold in the old man’s head before he opened the window of his room on the ground floor of the Old Folks’ Home in the town of Malmköping, and stepped out—into the flower bed. This maneuver required a bit of effort, since Allan was 100 years old, on this very day in fact. There was less than an hour to go before his birthday party would begin in the lounge of the Old Folks’ Home. The mayor would be there. And the local paper. And all the other old people. And the entire staff, led by bad-tempered Director Alice. It was only the Birthday Boy himself who didn’t intend to turn up."

He winked at my sister Lecia and me before turning to my gray-haired mother, now bent over her copy of Marcus Aurelius and a bowl of sinus-opening chili, and he quipped, “Now Miss Karr, this looks like a bullet hole.“ Lecia didn’t miss a beat, saying, “Mother, isn’t that where you shot at daddy?“ And Mother squinted up, slid her glasses down her patrician-looking nose and said, very blasé?, “No, that’s where I shot at Larry.“ She wheeled to point at another wall, adding, “Over there’s where I shot at your daddy.“"
Mary Karr,Cherry,2000,"No road offers more mystery than that first one you mount from the town you were born to, the first time you mount it of your own volition, on a trip funded by your own coffee tin of wrinkled up dollars—bills you’ve saved and scrounged for, worked the all-night switchboard for, missed the Rolling Stones for, sold fragrant pot with smashed flowers going brown inside twist-tie plastic baggies for. In fact, to disembark from your origins, you’ve done everything you can think to scrounge money save selling your spanking young pussy."

Jean Kerr,Please Don't Eat the Daisies,1957,"I had the feeling all along that this book should have an Introduction, because it doesn’t have an Index and it ought to have something."

Fran Lebowitz,Metropolitan Life,1978,As one with a distinct aversion to newspapers I rely heavily for information on the random remarks of others. Therefore my sources are far from impeccable.

A. J. Liebling,The Telephone Booth Indian,1942,"There was once a French-Canadian whose name I cannot at present recall but who had a window in his stomach.

Mark Manson,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,2016,"Charles Bukowski was an alcoholic, a womanizer, a chronic gambler, a lout, a cheapskate, a deadbeat, and on his worst days, a poet.

Groucho Marx,Groucho and Me,1959,"The trouble with writing a book about yourself is that you can’t fool around. If you write about someone else, you can stretch the truth from here to Finland.

George Barr McCutcheon,Brewster’s Millions,1902,"“The Little Sons of the Rich” were gathered about the long table in Pettingill’s studio. There were nine of them present, besides Brewster.

Randy Rainbow,Playing with Myself,2022,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times…. Fine, I didn’t write that. But it’s how I really wanted the opening chapter of this book to begin.

Mary Roach,Stiff,2003,"The way I see it, being dead is not terribly far off from being on a cruise ship. Most of your time is spent lying on your back. The brain has shut down. The flesh begins to soften. Nothing much new happens, and nothing is expected of you."
Mary Roach,Spook,2005,"I don’t recall my mood the morning I was born, but I imagine I felt a bit out of sorts. Nothing I looked at was familiar.

Salinger,The Catcher in the Rye,1951,"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth."
George Sanders,Memoirs of a Professional Cad,1960,"On July 3, 1906, the world was at peace. Nothing of any consequence seemed to be happening in the capital cities of any of its countries.

At number 6 Petroffski Ostroff, to Margaret and Henry Sanders, a son of dazzling beauty and infinite charm was being born. It was I."

Peter Schjeldahl,The Village Voice,,"At a dinner party recently, a nice young political consultant rhapsodized to me about the portent of the millennium, in which he saw the dawn of, yes, a New Age.

Josh Shaffer,News &amp; Observer,,"To the ears of a musical novice, the tuba ranks lowest in the family of instruments—an oafish cousin with a voice like a bullfrog. It lacks the flash of a saxophone, the brashness of a trumpet or the showiness of a piccolo—the melodic equivalent of a St. Bernard, warbling from the orchestra’s back row."

Popping beer cans, revving scooter engines, singing along with the radio, that sort of thing. Harmless, goofy, peaceful stuff. No hint whatsoever that, before this day was over, it would turn into a life and death adventure of which I would be the unlikely hero. But we’ll get to that."
Laurence Shames,The Paradise Gig,2020,"Well, the whole thing started with a woman standing on her head. She was doing this yoga-style, on Smathers Beach in Key West, Florida, just a few short weeks ago. It was a beautifully ordinary day, sunny with a salty breeze. She was minding her own business, upside down, when two men suddenly approached her towel. They might have pushed her over but it’s hard to say for sure. Anyway, she came down off her head, left the beach with them, and wasn’t seen for several days. After that, a bunch of crazy stuff happened, and seemed to happen very fast."
Laurence Shames,Key West Normal,2021,Some folks say you can’t make this stuff up.
Laurence Shames,Relative Humidity,,"Now and then, not often, life offers up a perfect moment, a moment when everything just fits together, almost as if there was a plan, as if the world had been designed to be at least an occasional Paradise for those who took the trouble to notice its ingenious construction, as if life would be a calm and peaceful pleasure if that moment just went on and on. But of course it never does."
Allan Sherman,A Gift of Laughter,1965,"My life has been a wild ride, up-and-down, up-and-down. I have always been a yo-yo on a roller coaster, and if I never quite fell off—if I’ve been able to hang on and enjoy the ride this far—it is because God gave me one shining thing, a gift of laughter."

Andrew Smith,100 Sideways Miles,2014,"Look: I do not know where I actually came from. I wonder, I suspect, but I do not know. I am not the only one who sometimes thinks I came from the pages of a book my father wrote. Maybe it’s like that for all boys of a certain—or uncertain—age: We feel as though there are no choices we’d made through all those miles and miles behind us that hadn’t been scripted by our fathers, and that our futures are only a matter of flipping the next page that was written ahead of us. I am not the only one who’s ever been trapped inside a book."
Andrew Smith,Grasshopper Jungle,2014,"I read somewhere that human beings are genetically predisposed to record history. We believe it will prevent us from doing stupid things in the future.

Lemony Snicket (pen name of Daniel Handler),"The Bad Beginning, or, Orphans",1999,"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, you would be better off reading some other book.

Lemony Snicket (pen name of Daniel Handler),The Austere Academy,2000,"If you were going to give a gold medal to the least delightful person on Earth, you would have to give that medal to a person named Carmelita Spats, and if you didn’t give it to her, Carmelita Spats was the sort of person who would snatch it from your hands anyway."
Rebecca Solnit,Men Explain Things to Me,2014,"One evening over dinner in March 2008, I began to joke, as I often had before, about writing an essay called “Men Explain Things to Me.” Every writer has a stable of ideas that never make it to the racetrack, and I’d been trotting this pony out recreationally once in a while."
Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg,Candy,1958,"“I’ve read many books,” said Professor Mephesto, with an odd finality, wearily flattening his hands on the podium, addressing the seventy-six sophomores who sat in easy reverence, immortalizing his every phrase with their pads and pens, and now, as always, giving him the confidence to slowly, artfully dramatize his words, to pause, shrug, frown, gaze abstractly at the ceiling, allow a wan wistful smile to play at his lips, and repeat quietly, “many books . . .” [ellipsis in original]"

Richard Stengel,You’re Too Kind,2002,"Perfect, gentle reader: I will not begin this book with a tribute to your discernment, because a person of your obvious accomplishments would certainly be immune to such blandishments. You would surely see through such transparent puffery and reject it out of hand. Someone with as much self-assurance and insight as you would not want any soft soap and sycophancy, but rather candor and direct truth. Well, nothing personal, dear reader, but I doubt it."
Nina Stibbe,Man at the Helm,2014,My sister and I and our little brother were born (in that order) into a very good situation and apart from the odd new thing life was humdrum and comfortable until an evening in 1970 when our mother listened in to our father’s phone call and ended up blowing her nose on a tea towel—a thing she’d only have done in an absolute emergency.

Rufi Thorpe,Margo’s Got Money Troubles,2024,"You are about to begin reading a new book, and to be honest, you are a little tense. The beginning of a novel is like a first date.

John Kennedy Toole,A Confederacy of Dunces,1980,"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs. In the shadow under the green visor of the cap Ignatius J. Reilly’s supercilious blue and yellow eyes looked down upon the other people waiting under the clock at the D. H. Holmes department store, studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste in dress."

Dan Wakefield,Starting Over,1973,"Potter was lucky; everyone told him so. “You’re lucky,” they said, “that you didn’t have any children.” Divorce wasn’t any bowl of cherries, of course, but as long as there weren’t any children involved it wasn’t an irreparable damage, like the sundering of a full-blown family. Just the busted dream of a couple of consenting adults. When Potter met new people and the subject of his recent divorce came up, he was congratulated so often for not having any children, he was tempted to start passing out cigars in celebration, saying heartily, “It wasn’t a boy—or a girl!”"

Throughout, he was still holding on to his dong."

Donald E. Westlake [see also RICHARD STARK],Help I Am Being Held Prisoner,1974,"Sometimes I think I’m good and sometimes I think I’m bad. I wish I could make up my mind, so I’d know what stance to take.

P. G. Wodehouse,The Luck of the Bodkins,1935,"Into the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the Hotel Magnifique at Cannes there had crept a look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French."

I nod and he follows me into the tiny room. I light the lamp so I can see him better. Then I sit on the small wooden crate that contains my belongings and wait. He kneels on the floor before me, his body tense as the strings on the shamisen I used to play. “The fighting was close today,” I say to him. The soldier looks frightened—they all do. He nods and bows his head. But I have already looked into his eyes—eyes that have seen too much. He reaches for me and I flinch. It’s a mistake. His eyes flash as the wounded beast within him roars. He hits me, striking at me with all of his pent up rage. Then he rapes me."
Ian Fleming,Casino Royale,1953,The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion produced by high gambling–a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension–becomes unbearable and the senses awake [sic] and revolt from it.

Frederick Forsyth,The Outsider,2015,"We all make mistakes, but starting the Third World War would have been a rather large one."
Charles Frazier,Cold Mountain,1997,"At the first gesture of morning, flies began stirring. Inman’s eyes and the long wound at his neck drew them, and the sound of their wings and the touch of their feet were soon more potent than a handful of roosters in rousing a man to wake."

Ernest Hemingway,A Farewell to Arms,1929,"In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders, dry and white in the sun, and the water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the channels. Troops went by the house and down the road and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the trees.

Thomas Keneally,Schindler’s Ark,1982,"In Poland’s deepest autumn, a tall young man in an expensive overcoat, double-breasted dinner jacket beneath it and—in the lapel of the dinner jacket—a large ornamental gold-on-black enamel swastika, emerged from a fashionable apartment block in Straszewskiego Street on the edge of the ancient center of Crakow, and saw his chauffeur waiting with fuming breath by the open door of an enormous and, even in this blackened world, lustrous Adler limousine. “Watch the pavement, Herr Schindler,” said the chauffeur. “It’s icy like a widow’s heart.”"

Norman Mailer,The Naked and the Dead,1948,"Nobody could sleep.

He had a long heavy beard, and his hair was hanging down over his ears to his neck, and he had his hand out trying to thumb a ride from a car that was stopped at the pump. To see him there, leaning on one hip, a Coke bottle in his hand and a rolled-up sleeping bag near his boots on the tar pavement, you could never have guessed that on Tuesday, a day later, most of the police in Basalt County would be hunting him down."
Viet Thanh Nguyen,The Sympathizer,2015,"I am a spy, sleeper, a spook, a man of two faces. Perhaps not surprisingly, I am a man of two minds.

Charles Osgood,Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack,2004,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Charles Dickens didn’t write those words about the year that I was nine in Baltimore, but they happen to fit.

Heather Cox Richardson,How the South Won the Civil War,2020,The moment in July 1964 when Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater took the stage at Cow Palace outside San Francisco and beamed at the cheering Republicans who had just nominated him for president is iconic—but not for the reasons we remember.

William Styron,Sophie’s Choice,1979,"In those days cheap apartments were almost impossible to find in Manhattan, so I had to move to Brooklyn. This was in 1947, and one of the pleasant features of that summer which I so vividly remember was the weather, which was sunny and mild, flower-fragrant, almost as if the days had been arrested in a seemingly perpetual springtime.

Herman Wouk,The Caine Mutiny,1951,"It was not a mutiny in the old-time sense, of course, with flashing of cutlasses, a captain in chains, and desperate sailors turning outlaws. After all, it happened in 1944 in the United States Navy. But the court of inquiry recommended trial for mutiny, and the episode became known as “the Caine mutiny” throughout the service. The story begins with Willie Keith because the event turned on his personality as the massive door of a vault turns on a small jewel bearing."
Herman Wouk,The Winds of War,1971,"Commander Victor Henry rode a taxicab home from the Navy Building on Constitution Avenue, in a gusty gray March rainstorm that matched his mood. In his War Plans cubbyhole that afternoon, he had received an unexpected word from on high which, to his seasoned appraisal, had probably blown a well-planned career to rags. Now he had to consult his wife about an urgent decision; yet he did not altogether trust her opinions."
Edward Abbey,Good News,1980,"Two men sit on a rock halfway up the slope of a desert mountain. Sundown: The air is still, caught in the pause between the heat of the day, the cool of the evening.

Andy Adams,Cattle Brands: A Collection of Winter Camp-Fire Stories,1906,The ease and apparent willingness with which some men revert to an aimless life can best be accounted for by the savage or barbarian instincts of our natures.
Andy Adams,Cattle Brands: A Collection of Winter Camp-Fire Stories,1906,"He was born in a chaparral thicket, south of the Nueces River in Texas. It was a warm night in April, with a waning moon hanging like a hunter’s horn high overhead, when the subject of this sketch drew his first breath.

Custer, James B. “Wild Bill” Hickok, Wyatt Earp, and many others, surviving Custer’s fight at the Little Bighorn River, which the Indians called the Greasy Grass."
Michael Blake,Dances with Wolves,1988,Lieutenant Dunbar wasn’t really swallowed. But that was the first word that stuck in his mind.
Bruce Borges,The Bitter Past,2023,"We don’t have a lot of murder in Lincoln County. The long stretches of open road provide us with more than our share of high-speed vehicular deaths, the images of which can haunt your dreams, but there just isn’t a lot of killing other people on purpose. When we do encounter it, it’s never like this. This is something from hell."
Dee Brown,The Way to Bright Star,1998,"Thinking about the circus coming to town led me to pull out this shoe box of faded photographs that I keep in the bottom of Old Man Fagerhalt’s desk. I have not looked at them for a long time, maybe a year or more."

Bret Harte,Overland Monthly,,"As Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler, stepped into the main street of Poker Flat on the morning of the twenty-third of November, 1850, he was conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere from the preceding night. Two or three men, conversing earnestly together, ceased as he approached, and exchanged significant glances. There was a Sabbath lull in the air, which, in a settlement unused to Sabbath influences, looked ominous."
Bret Harte,The Luck of Roaring Camp and Other Sketches,1870,"Just where the Sierra Nevada begins to subside in gentler undulations, and the rivers grow less rapid and yellow, on the side of a great red mountain, stands “Smith’s Pocket.” Seen from the red road at sunset, in the red light and the red dust, its white houses look like the outcroppings of quartz on the mountain-side."
Bret Harte,The Luck of Roaring Camp and Other Sketches,1870,"Sandy was very drunk. He was lying under an azalea-bush, in pretty much the same attitude in which he had fallen some hours before."
Bret Harte,Cressy,1889,"As the master of the Indian Spring school emerged from the pine woods into the little clearing before the school-house, he stopped whistling, put his hat less jauntily on his head, threw away some wild flowers he had gathered on his way, and otherwise assumed the severe demeanor of his profession and his mature age—which was at least twenty."
Craig Johnson,The Cold Dish,2004,"“Bob Barnes says they got a dead baby out in BLM land. He’s on line one.” She might have knocked, but I didn’t hear it because I was watching the geese.

Louis L’Amour,Hondo,1953,"He rolled the cigarettes in his lips, liking the taste of tobacco, squinting his eyes against the sun glare. His buckskin shirt, seasoned by sun, rain, and sweat, smelled stale and old. His jeans had long since faded to a neutral color that lost itself against the desert."
Louis L’Amour,Radigan,1958,"A rifle fired from the house and Radigan dove for the brush, falling on his hands as a second bullet clipped brush ahead of him. He rolled over, catching a quick glimpse of Angelina Foley herself standing near the porch, working the lever on the Winchester."

Louis L’Amour,Sackett,1961,"It wasn’t as if he hadn’t been warned. He got it straight, with no beating around the mesquite. “Mister,” I said, “if you ain’t any slicker with that pistol than you were with that bottom deal, you’d better not have at it.” Trouble was, he wouldn’t be content with one mistake, he had to make two; so he had at it, and they buried him out west of town where men were buried who die by the gun. And me, William Tell Sackett, who came to Uvalde a stranger and alone, I found myself a talked-about man."

Louis L’Amour,The Man Called Noon,1970,"Somebody wanted to kill him. The idea was in his mind when he opened his eyes to the darkness of a narrow space between two buildings.

Louis L’Amour,Lonely on the Mountain,1980,There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. That will be the beginning.
Alan Le May,The Searchers,1954,"Supper was over by sundown, and Henry Edwards walked out from the house for a last look around. He carried his light shotgun, in hopes the rest of the family would think he meant to pick up a sage hen or two—a highly unlikely prospect anywhere near the house. He had left his gun belt on its peg beside the door, but he had sneaked the heavy six-gun itself into his waistband inside his shirt."
Elmore Leonard,The Bounty Hunters,1953,Dave Flynn stretched his boots over the footrest and his body eased lower into the barber chair.
Elmore Leonard,The Tonto Woman and Other Western Stories,1982,"A time would come, within a few years, when Ruben Vega would go to the church in Benson, kneel in the confessional, and say to the priest, “Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been thirty-seven years since my last confession.”"

He gets up, scratching the grey wedge of belly and pubic hair, shuffles to the gas burner, pours leftover coffee in a chipped enamel pan; the flame swathes it in blue. He turns on the tap and urinates in the sink, pulls on his shirt and jeans, his worn boots, stamping the heels against the floor to get them full on."

Conrad Aiken,Great Circle,1933,"Why be in such a hurry, old fool? What good is hurry going to do you? Wrap yourself in a thick gauze of delay and confusion, like the spider; hang there, like the spider, aware of time only as the rock is aware of time; let your days be as leisurely and profound as months, serene as the blue spaces of sky between clouds; your flies will come to you in due season."

Nelson Algren,The Man with the Golden Arm,1949,"The captain never drank. Yet, toward nightfall in that smoke-colored season between Indian summer and December’s first true snow, he would sometimes feel half drunken. He would hang his coat neatly over the back of his chair in the leaden station-house twilight, say he was beat from lack of sleep and lay his head across his arms upon the query room desk."
Nelson Algren,A Walk on the Wild Side,1956,"“He’s just a pore lonesome wife-left feller,“ the more understanding said of Fitz Linkhorn, “losing his old lady is what crazied him.“ “That man is so contrary,“ the less understanding said, “if you throwed him in the river he’d float upstream.“ For what had embittered him Fitz had no name. Yet he felt that every daybreak duped him into waking and every evening conned him into sleep. The feeling of having been cheated—of having been cheated—that was it. Nobody knew why nor by whom."

John Berendt,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,1994,"He was tall, about fifty, with darkly handsome, almost sinister features: a neatly trimmed mustache, hair turning silver at the temples, and eyes so black they were like the tinted windows of a sleek limousine—he could see out, but you couldn’t see in."
Lou Berney,Dark Ride,2023,"I’m lost, wandering, and somewhat stoned."
Tamara Berry,Murder Off the Books,2023,"Gertrude’s corpse lay at an unnatural angle on the floor of the Paper Trail Bookstore. Her pale skin glowed eerily under the lights, her deathly pallor made starker by the winged liner that circled her eyelids like a burlesque raccoon. No one in the store could discern the cause of her death, but it was obvious to any trained eye that— “Ouch. I think there’s a rock under my hip. Wait a sec.” The corpse wriggled, shifted, and dislodged a pebble from beneath the waistband of her torn black jeans. “Never mind,” she said as she popped the rock into her mouth. “It’s just a jelly bean.”"

Avery Bishop,Girl Gone Mad,2020,"The girl cut herself.

William Peter Blatty,The Exorcist,1971,"Like the brief doomed flare of exploding suns that registers dimly on blind men’s eyes, the beginning of the horror passed almost unnoticed; in the shriek of what followed, in fact, was forgotten and perhaps not connected to the horror at all.

Lawrence Block,The Crime of Our Lives,2015,It was in the eleventh grade that I knew I would be a writer. The conviction grew out of two awarenesses that dawned at about the same time.
Howard Blum,,,"Everybody’s looking for love, right? Love is all you need. At least that’s what they keep telling you. So why should you be any different? You have needs, too. So you just sit in your room and scroll through FB, or Insta, or Tok—and there they are. It might as well be Tinder. All of them looking so pretty."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"Stepping into the courtroom, you know the score. Only one thing matters: getting your client off the hook. So if the facts are on your side, you pound ’em. If not, pound the table."
Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"You know how cops work. You know what they look for. You know the questions they’ll ask. You know all their tricks. You’re prepared. Well trained. After all. You’ve taken the classes. Earned the degrees. You’ve gotten into the heads of bad guys; written “crime scripts,” as your profs call them. You learned from their mistakes."

Murder is hard work, especially if people fight back."

Howard Blum,Air Mail,,"Ever try dodging a bullet? That’s a challenge, all right. But suppose you need to dodge five bullets. And each of the five shooters has a long gun aimed straight at your heart. Oh, and you’re strapped tight to a chair, to boot."

Phyllis Bottome,The Lifeline,1946,"Mark Chalmers was, as far as he knew, exactly the kind of man he wanted to be. He earned enough money for his tasks; he had done nothing discreditable; women admired him, boys obeyed him; and men of his own age definitely disliked him...."

Andrea Camilleri,The Terra-Cotta Dog,,"To judge from the entrance the dawn was making, it promised to be a very iffy day—that is, blasts of angry sunlight one minute, fits of freezing rain the next, all of it seasoned with sudden gusts of wind—one of those days when someone who is sensitive to abrupt shifts in weather and suffers them in his blood and brain is likely to change opinion and direction continuously, like those sheets of tin, cut in the shape of banners and roosters, that spin every which way on rooftops with each new puff of wind."

Raymond Chandler,The Big Sleep,1939,"It was about eleven o’clock in the morning, mid October, with the sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt, tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved, and sober, and I didn’t care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars."
Raymond Chandler,The Lady in the Lake,1943,"The Treloar Building was, and is, on Olive Street, near Sixth, on the west side. The sidewalk in front of it had been built of black and white rubber blocks.

Raymond Chandler,The Little Sister,1949,The pebbled glass door panel is lettered in flaked black paint: “Phillip Marlowe...Investigations.“ It is a reasonably shabby door at the end of a reasonably shabby corridor in the sort of building that was new about the year the all-tile bathroom became the basis of civilization.

She said: ""I need a man."""
Raymond Chandler,The Long Goodbye,1953,"The first time I laid eyes on Terry Lennox he was drunk in a Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith outside the terrace of The Dancers.

Lee Child,Killing Floor,1997,"I was arrested in Eno’s diner. At twelve o’clock. I was eating eggs and drinking coffee. A late breakfast, not lunch. I was wet and tired after a long walk in heavy rain. All the way from the highway to the edge of town."

Agatha Christie,The Murder at the Vicarage,1930,"It is difficult to know quite where to begin this story, but I have fixed my choice on a certain Wednesday at luncheon at the Vicarage.

Agatha Christie,The Moving Finger,1942,"When at last I was taken out of the plaster, and the doctors had pulled me about to their hearts’ content, and nurses had wheedled me into cautiously using my limbs, and I had been nauseated by their practically using baby talk to me, Marcus Kent told me I was to go and live in the country."

Sara Collins,The Confessions of Frannie Langton,2019,"My trial starts the way my life did: a squall of elbows and shoving and spit. From the prisoners’ hold they take me through the gallery, down the stairs and past the table crawling with barristers and clerks. Around me a river of faces in flood, their mutters rising, blending with the lawyers’ whispers. A noise that hums with all the spite of bees in a bush. Heads turn as I enter. Every eye a skewer."
Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892,"I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.

Arthur Conan Doyle,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892,"To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind."
Michael Connelly,The Poet,1996,"Death is my beat. I make my living from it. I forge my professional reputation on it. I treat it with the passion and precision of an undertaker—somber and sympathetic about it when I’m with the bereaved, a skilled craftsman with it when I’m alone. I’ve always thought the secret of dealing with death was to keep it at arm’s length. That’s the rule. Don’t let it breathe in your face. But my rule didn’t protect me."
Barnaby Conrad,La Fiesta Brava,1953,"On August 27, 1947, a multimillionaire and a bull killed each other in Linares, Spain, and plunged an entire nation into deep mourning.

James Crumley,The Mexican Tree Duck,1993,"When the 3:12 through freight to Spokane hit the East Meriweather crossing, the engineer touched his horn and released a long, mournful wail into the wet, snowy air of our second early fall storm in Western Montana.

E. L.

Bret Easton Ellis,American Psycho,1991,"ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE is scrawled in blood red lettering on the side of the Chemical Bank near the corner of Eleventh and First and is in print large enough to be seen from the backseat of the cab as it lurches forward in the traffic leaving Wall Street and just as Timothy Price notices the words a bus pulls up, the advertisement for Les Misérables on its side blocking his view, but Price who is with Pierce & Pierce and twenty-six doesn’t seem to care because he tells the driver he will give him five dollars to turn up the radio, “Be My Baby” on WYNN, and the driver, black, not American, does so."

Janet Evanovich,High Five,1999,"When I was a little girl I used to dress Barbie up without underpants. On the outside, she’d look like the perfect lady. Tasteful plastic heels, tailored suit. But underneath, she was naked."
Percival Everett,The Trees,2021,"Money, Mississippi, looks exactly like it sounds. Named in that persistent Southern tradition of irony and with the attendant tradition of nescience, the name becomes slightly sad, a marker of self-conscious ignorance that might as well be embraced because, let’s face it, it isn’t going away."
Douglas Fairbairn,Shoot,1973,This is what happened.

Gillian Flynn,Dark Places,2009,"I have a meanness inside of me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it. It’s the Day blood. Something’s wrong with it. I was never a good little girl, and I got worse after the murders."
Gillian Flynn,Gone Girl,2012,"When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it. Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil. She had what the Victorians would call a finely shaped head. You could imagine the skull quite easily. I’d know her head anywhere."
Vince Flynn,Term Limits,1997,"The old wood cabin sat alone, surrounded by trees and darkness. The shades were drawn, and a dog lay motionless on the front porch.

The sky is a milky blue above us; no vegetation grows this far up so it is just me and him, the stones and the still black water. He straddles the narrow track with both booted feet and he smiles. I realize several things. That I passed him earlier, farther down the glen. We greeted each other, in the amiable yet brief manner of those on a country walk. That, on this remote stretch of path, there is no one near enough to hear me call. That he has been waiting for me: he has planned this whole thing, carefully, meticulously, and I have walked into his trap. I see all this, in an instant"

I imagined the day her fairy hair was long enough to capture in pigtails, her nose pressed to the glass of a school bus window; I saw her first crush, prom dress, heartbreak. Each vision was a bead on a rosary of future memories; I prayed daily. As it turned out, I was not a zealot…only a martyr. When I gave birth, and the doctor announced the baby’s sex, I did not believe it at first. I had done such a stellar job of convincing myself of what I wanted that I completely forgot what I needed.
